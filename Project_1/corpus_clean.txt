MEANING OF THAT STORY OF NARCISSUS WHO BECAUSEHE COULD NOT GRASP THE TORMENTING MILD IMAGE HE SAW IN THE FOUNTAINPLUNGED INTO IT AND WAS DROWNED BUT THAT SAME IMAGE WE OURSELVES SEEIN ALL RIVERS AND OCEANS IT IS THE IMAGE OF THE UNGRASPABLE PHANTOM OFLIFE AND THIS IS THE KEY TO IT ALLNOW WHEN I SAY THAT I AM IN THE HABIT OF GOING TO SEA WHENEVER I BEGINTO GROW HAZY ABOUT THE EYES AND BEGIN TO BE

AS ACOMMODORE OR A CAPTAIN OR A COOK I ABANDON THE GLORY AND DISTINCTIONOF SUCH OFFICES TO THOSE WHO LIKE THEM FOR MY PART I ABOMINATE ALLHONOURABLE RESPECTABLE TOILS TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF EVERY KINDWHATSOEVER IT IS QUITE AS MUCH AS I CAN DO TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELFWITHOUT TAKING CARE OF SHIPS BARQUES BRIGS SCHOONERS AND WHAT NOTAND AS FOR GOING AS COOKTHOUGH I CONFESS THERE IS CONSIDERABLE

SPEAK MORE RESPECTFULLY NOT TO SAY REVERENTIALLY OF A BROILEDFOWL THAN I WILL IT IS OUT OF THE IDOLATROUS DOTINGS OF THE OLDEGYPTIANS UPON BROILED IBIS AND ROASTED RIVER HORSE THAT YOU SEE THEMUMMIES OF THOSE CREATURES IN THEIR HUGE BAKEHOUSES THE PYRAMIDSNO WHEN I GO TO SEA I GO AS A SIMPLE SAILOR RIGHT BEFORE THE MASTPLUMB DOWN INTO THE FORECASTLE ALOFT THERE TO THE ROYAL MASTHEADTRUE THEY RATHER ORDER ME ABOUT SOME AND MAKE ME JUMP FROM SPAR TOSPAR LIKE A GRASSHOPPER IN A MAY MEADOW AND AT FIRST THIS SORTOF THING IS UNPLEASANT ENOUGH IT TOUCHES ONES SENSE OF HONOURPARTICULARLY IF YOU COME OF AN OLD ESTABLISHED FAMILY IN THE LAND THEVAN RENSSELAERS OR RANDOLPHS OR HARDICANUTES AND MORE THAN ALLIF JUST PREVIOUS TO PUTTING YOUR HAND INTO THE TARPOT YOU HAVE BEENLORDING IT AS A COUNTRY SCHOOLMASTER MAKING THE TALLEST BOYS STANDIN AWE OF YOU THE TRANSITION IS A KEEN ONE I ASSURE YOU FROM ASCHOOLMASTER TO A SAILOR AND REQUIRES A STRONG DECOCTION OF SENECA ANDTHE STOICS TO ENABLE YOU TO GRIN AND BEAR IT BUT EVEN THIS WEARS OFF INTIMEWHAT OF IT IF SOME OLD HUNKS OF A SEACAPTAIN ORDERS ME TO GET A BROOMAND SWEEP DOWN THE DECKS WHAT DOES THAT INDIGNITY AMOUNT TO WEIGHEDI MEAN IN THE SCALES OF THE NEW TESTAMENT DO YOU THINK THE ARCHANGELGABRIEL THINKS ANYTHING THE LESS OF ME BECAUSE I PROMPTLY ANDRESPECTFULLY OBEY THAT OLD HUNKS IN THAT PARTICULAR INSTANCE WHOAINT A SLAVE TELL ME THAT WELL THEN HOWEVER THE OLD SEACAPTAINSMAY ORDER ME ABOUTHOWEVER THEY MAY THUMP AND PUNCH ME ABOUT I HAVETHE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT IT IS ALL RIGHT THAT EVERYBODY ELSE ISONE WAY OR OTHER SERVED IN MUCH THE SAME WAYEITHER IN A PHYSICALOR METAPHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW THAT IS AND SO THE UNIVERSAL THUMP ISPASSED ROUND AND ALL HANDS SHOULD RUB EACH OTHERS SHOULDERBLADESAND BE CONTENTAGAIN I ALWAYS GO TO SEA AS A SAILOR BECAUSE THEY MAKE A POINT OFPAYING ME FOR MY TROUBLE WHEREAS THEY NEVER PAY PASSENGERS A SINGLEPENNY THAT I EVER HEARD OF ON THE CONTRARY PASSENGERS THEMSELVES MUSTPAY AND THERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD BETWEEN PAYINGAND BEING PAID THE ACT OF PAYING IS PERHAPS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLEINFLICTION THAT THE TWO ORCHARD THIEVES ENTAILED UPON US BUT BEINGPAIDWHAT WILL COMPARE WITH IT THE URBANE ACTIVITY WITH WHICH A MANRECEIVES MONEY IS REALLY MARVELLOUS CONSIDERING THAT WE SO EARNESTLYBELIEVE MONEY TO BE THE ROOT OF ALL EARTHLY ILLS AND THAT ON NO ACCOUNTCAN A MONIED MAN ENTER HEAVEN AH HOW CHEERFULLY WE CONSIGN OURSELVESTO PERDITIONFINALLY I ALWAYS GO TO SEA AS A SAILOR BECAUSE OF THE WHOLESOMEEXERCISE AND PURE AIR OF THE FORECASTLE DECK FOR AS IN THIS WORLDHEAD WINDS ARE FAR MORE PREVALENT THAN WINDS FROM ASTERN THAT ISIF YOU NEVER VIOLATE THE PYTHAGOREAN MAXIM SO FOR THE MOST PART THECOMMODORE ON THE QUARTERDECK GETS HIS ATMOSPHERE AT SECOND HAND FROMTHE SAILORS ON THE FORECASTLE HE THINKS HE BREATHES IT FIRST BUT NOTSO IN MUCH THE SAME WAY DO THE COMMONALTY LEAD THEIR LEADERS IN MANYOTHER THINGS AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE LEADERS LITTLE SUSPECT ITBUT WHEREFORE IT WAS THAT AFTER HAVING REPEATEDLY SMELT THE SEA AS AMERCHANT SAILOR I SHOULD NOW TAKE IT INTO MY HEAD TO GO ON A WHALINGVOYAGE THIS THE INVISIBLE POLICE

A MOMENT AND THEN UP STAIRS WE WENT AND I WASUSHERED INTO A SMALL ROOM COLD AS A CLAM AND FURNISHED SURE ENOUGHWITH A PRODIGIOUS BED ALMOST BIG ENOUGH INDEED FOR ANY FOUR HARPOONEERSTO SLEEP ABREASTTHERE SAID THE LANDLORD PLACING THE CANDLE ON A CRAZY OLD SEACHEST THAT DID DOUBLE DUTY AS A WASHSTAND AND CENTRE TABLE THEREMAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE NOW AND GOOD NIGHT TO YE I TURNED ROUNDFROM EYEING THE BED BUT HE HAD DISAPPEAREDFOLDING BACK THE COUNTERPANE I STOOPED OVER THE BED THOUGH NONE OF THEMOST ELEGANT IT YET STOOD THE SCRUTINY TOLERABLY WELL I THEN GLANCEDROUND THE ROOM AND BESIDES THE BEDSTEAD AND CENTRE TABLE COULD SEENO OTHER FURNITURE BELONGING TO THE PLACE BUT A RUDE SHELF THE FOURWALLS AND A PAPERED FIREBOARD REPRESENTING A MAN STRIKING A WHALE OFTHINGS NOT PROPERLY BELONGING TO THE ROOM THERE WAS A HAMMOCK LASHEDUP AND THROWN UPON THE FLOOR IN ONE CORNER ALSO A LARGE SEAMANSBAG CONTAINING THE HARPOONEERS WARDROBE NO DOUBT IN LIEU OF A LANDTRUNK LIKEWISE THERE WAS A PARCEL OF OUTLANDISH BONE FISH HOOKS ON THESHELF OVER THE FIREPLACE AND A TALL HARPOON STANDING AT THE HEAD OFTHE BEDBUT WHAT IS THIS ON THE CHEST I TOOK IT UP AND HELD IT CLOSE TO THELIGHT AND FELT IT AND SMELT IT AND TRIED EVERY WAY POSSIBLE TO ARRIVEAT SOME SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION CONCERNING IT I CAN COMPARE IT TONOTHING BUT A LARGE DOOR MAT ORNAMENTED AT THE EDGES WITH LITTLETINKLING TAGS SOMETHING LIKE THE STAINED PORCUPINE QUILLS ROUND ANINDIAN MOCCASIN THERE WAS A HOLE OR SLIT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS MATAS YOU SEE THE SAME IN SOUTH AMERICAN PONCHOS BUT COULD IT BE POSSIBLETHAT ANY SOBER HARPOONEER WOULD GET INTO A DOOR MAT AND PARADE THESTREETS OF ANY CHRISTIAN TOWN IN THAT SORT OF GUISE I PUT IT ON TO TRYIT AND IT WEIGHED ME DOWN LIKE A HAMPER BEING UNCOMMONLY SHAGGY ANDTHICK AND I THOUGHT A LITTLE DAMP AS THOUGH THIS MYSTERIOUS HARPOONEERHAD BEEN WEARING IT OF A RAINY DAY I WENT UP IN IT TO A BIT OF GLASSSTUCK AGAINST THE WALL AND I NEVER SAW SUCH A SIGHT IN MY LIFE I TOREMYSELF OUT OF IT IN SUCH A HURRY THAT I GAVE MYSELF A KINK IN THE NECKI SAT DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE BED AND COMMENCED THINKING ABOUT THISHEADPEDDLING HARPOONEER AND HIS DOOR MAT AFTER THINKING SOME TIME ONTHE BEDSIDE I GOT UP AND TOOK OFF MY MONKEY JACKET AND THEN STOOD INTHE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM THINKING I THEN TOOK OFF MY COAT AND THOUGHTA LITTLE MORE IN MY SHIRT SLEEVES BUT BEGINNING TO FEEL VERY COLD NOWHALF UNDRESSED AS I WAS AND REMEMBERING WHAT THE LANDLORD SAID ABOUTTHE HARPOONEERS NOT COMING HOME AT ALL THAT NIGHT IT BEING SO VERYLATE I MADE NO MORE ADO BUT JUMPED OUT OF MY PANTALOONS AND BOOTS ANDTHEN BLOWING OUT THE LIGHT TUMBLED INTO BED AND COMMENDED MYSELF TO THECARE OF HEAVENWHETHER THAT MATTRESS WAS STUFFED WITH CORNCOBS OR BROKEN CROCKERYTHERE IS NO TELLING BUT I ROLLED ABOUT A GOOD DEAL AND COULD NOT SLEEPFOR A LONG TIME AT LAST I SLID OFF INTO A LIGHT DOZE AND HAD PRETTYNEARLY MADE A GOOD OFFING TOWARDS THE LAND OF NOD WHEN I HEARD A HEAVYFOOTFALL IN THE PASSAGE AND SAW A GLIMMER OF LIGHT COME INTO THE ROOMFROM UNDER THE DOORLORD SAVE ME THINKS I THAT MUST BE THE HARPOONEER THE INFERNALHEADPEDDLER BUT I LAY PERFECTLY STILL AND RESOLVED NOT TO SAY A WORDTILL SPOKEN TO HOLDING A LIGHT IN ONE HAND AND THAT IDENTICAL NEWZEALAND HEAD IN THE OTHER THE STRANGER ENTERED THE ROOM AND WITHOUTLOOKING TOWARDS THE BED PLACED HIS CANDLE A GOOD WAY OFF FROM ME ON THEFLOOR IN ONE CORNER AND THEN BEGAN WORKING AWAY AT THE KNOTTED CORDSOF THE LARGE BAG I BEFORE SPOKE OF AS BEING IN THE ROOM I WAS ALLEAGERNESS TO SEE HIS FACE BUT HE KEPT IT AVERTED FOR SOME TIME WHILEEMPLOYED IN UNLACING THE BAGS MOUTH THIS ACCOMPLISHED HOWEVER HETURNED ROUNDWHEN GOOD HEAVENS WHAT A SIGHT SUCH A FACE IT WAS OFA DARK PURPLISH YELLOW COLOUR HERE AND THERE STUCK OVER WITH LARGEBLACKISH LOOKING SQUARES YES ITS JUST AS I THOUGHT HES ATERRIBLE BEDFELLOW HES BEEN IN A FIGHT GOT DREADFULLY CUT AND HEREHE IS JUST FROM THE SURGEON BUT AT THAT MOMENT HE CHANCED TO TURNHIS FACE SO TOWARDS THE LIGHT THAT I PLAINLY SAW THEY COULD NOT BESTICKINGPLASTERS AT ALL THOSE BLACK SQUARES ON HIS CHEEKS THEY WERESTAINS OF SOME SORT OR OTHER AT FIRST I KNEW NOT WHAT TO MAKE OF THISBUT SOON AN INKLING OF THE TRUTH OCCURRED TO ME I REMEMBERED A STORYOF A WHITE MANA WHALEMAN TOOWHO FALLING AMONG THE CANNIBALS HADBEEN TATTOOED BY THEM I CONCLUDED THAT THIS HARPOONEER IN THE COURSEOF HIS DISTANT VOYAGES MUST HAVE MET WITH A SIMILAR ADVENTURE ANDWHAT IS IT THOUGHT I AFTER ALL ITS ONLY HIS OUTSIDE A MAN CANBE HONEST IN ANY SORT OF SKIN BUT THEN WHAT TO MAKE OF HIS UNEARTHLYCOMPLEXION THAT PART OF IT I MEAN LYING ROUND ABOUT AND COMPLETELYINDEPENDENT OF THE SQUARES OF TATTOOING TO BE SURE IT MIGHT BE NOTHINGBUT A GOOD COAT OF TROPICAL TANNING BUT I NEVER HEARD OF A HOT SUNSTANNING A WHITE MAN INTO A PURPLISH YELLOW ONE HOWEVER I HAD NEVERBEEN IN THE SOUTH SEAS AND PERHAPS THE SUN THERE PRODUCED THESEEXTRAORDINARY EFFECTS UPON THE SKIN NOW WHILE ALL THESE IDEAS WEREPASSING THROUGH ME LIKE LIGHTNING THIS HARPOONEER NEVER NOTICED MEAT ALL BUT AFTER SOME DIFFICULTY HAVING OPENED HIS BAG HE COMMENCEDFUMBLING IN IT AND PRESENTLY PULLED OUT A SORT OF TOMAHAWK AND ASEALSKIN WALLET WITH THE HAIR ON PLACING THESE ON THE OLD CHEST IN THEMIDDLE OF THE ROOM HE THEN TOOK THE NEW ZEALAND HEADA GHASTLY THINGENOUGHAND CRAMMED IT DOWN INTO THE BAG HE NOW TOOK OFF HIS HATANEW BEAVER HATWHEN I CAME NIGH SINGING OUT WITH FRESH SURPRISE THEREWAS NO HAIR ON HIS HEADNONE TO SPEAK OF AT LEASTNOTHING BUT ASMALL SCALPKNOT TWISTED UP ON HIS FOREHEAD HIS BALD PURPLISH HEAD NOWLOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MILDEWED SKULL HAD NOT THE STRANGERSTOOD BETWEEN ME AND THE DOOR I WOULD HAVE BOLTED OUT OF IT QUICKERTHAN EVER I BOLTED A DINNEREVEN AS IT WAS I THOUGHT SOMETHING OF SLIPPING OUT OF THE WINDOW BUTIT WAS THE SECOND FLOOR BACK I AM NO COWARD BUT WHAT TO MAKE OFTHIS HEADPEDDLING PURPLE RASCAL ALTOGETHER PASSED MY COMPREHENSIONIGNORANCE IS THE PARENT OF FEAR AND BEING COMPLETELY NONPLUSSED ANDCONFOUNDED ABOUT THE STRANGER I CONFESS I WAS NOW AS MUCH AFRAID OF HIMAS IF IT WAS THE DEVIL HIMSELF WHO HAD THUS BROKEN INTO MY ROOM ATTHE DEAD OF NIGHT IN FACT I WAS SO AFRAID OF HIM THAT I WAS NOTGAME ENOUGH JUST THEN TO ADDRESS HIM AND DEMAND A SATISFACTORY ANSWERCONCERNING WHAT SEEMED INEXPLICABLE IN HIMMEANWHILE HE CONTINUED THE BUSINESS OF UNDRESSING AND AT LAST SHOWEDHIS CHEST AND ARMS AS I LIVE THESE COVERED PARTS OF HIM WERE CHECKEREDWITH THE SAME SQUARES AS HIS FACE HIS BACK TOO WAS ALL OVER THE SAMEDARK SQUARES HE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN IN A THIRTY YEARS WAR AND JUSTESCAPED FROM IT WITH A STICKINGPLASTER SHIRT STILL MORE HIS VERYLEGS WERE MARKED AS IF A PARCEL OF DARK GREEN FROGS WERE RUNNING UPTHE TRUNKS OF YOUNG PALMS IT WAS NOW QUITE PLAIN THAT HE MUST BE SOMEABOMINABLE SAVAGE OR OTHER SHIPPED ABOARD OF A WHALEMAN IN THE SOUTHSEAS AND SO LANDED IN THIS CHRISTIAN COUNTRY I QUAKED TO THINK OF ITA PEDDLER OF HEADS TOOPERHAPS THE HEADS OF HIS OWN BROTHERS HE MIGHTTAKE A FANCY TO MINEHEAVENS LOOK AT THAT TOMAHAWKBUT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR SHUDDERING FOR NOW THE SAVAGE WENT ABOUTSOMETHING THAT COMPLETELY FASCINATED MY ATTENTION AND CONVINCED ME THATHE MUST INDEED BE A HEATHEN GOING TO HIS HEAVY GREGO OR WRAPALL ORDREADNAUGHT WHICH HE HAD PREVIOUSLY HUNG ON A CHAIR HE FUMBLED IN THEPOCKETS AND PRODUCED AT LENGTH A CURIOUS LITTLE DEFORMED IMAGE WITH AHUNCH ON ITS BACK AND EXACTLY THE COLOUR OF A THREE DAYS OLD CONGOBABY REMEMBERING THE EMBALMED HEAD AT FIRST I ALMOST THOUGHT THATTHIS BLACK MANIKIN WAS A REAL BABY PRESERVED IN SOME SIMILAR MANNER BUTSEEING THAT IT WAS NOT AT ALL LIMBER AND THAT IT GLISTENED A GOOD DEALLIKE POLISHED EBONY I CONCLUDED THAT IT MUST BE NOTHING BUT A WOODENIDOL WHICH INDEED IT PROVED TO BE FOR NOW THE SAVAGE GOES UP TO THEEMPTY FIREPLACE AND REMOVING THE PAPERED FIREBOARD SETS UP THISLITTLE HUNCHBACKED IMAGE LIKE A TENPIN BETWEEN THE ANDIRONS THECHIMNEY JAMBS AND ALL THE BRICKS INSIDE WERE VERY SOOTY SO THAT ITHOUGHT THIS FIREPLACE MADE A VERY APPROPRIATE LITTLE SHRINE OR CHAPELFOR HIS CONGO IDOLI NOW SCREWED MY EYES HARD TOWARDS THE HALF HIDDEN IMAGE FEELING BUTILL AT EASE MEANTIMETO SEE WHAT WAS NEXT TO FOLLOW FIRST HE TAKESABOUT A DOUBLE HANDFUL OF SHAVINGS OUT OF HIS GREGO POCKET AND PLACESTHEM CAREFULLY BEFORE THE IDOL THEN LAYING A BIT OF SHIP BISCUIT ONTOP AND APPLYING THE FLAME FROM THE LAMP HE KINDLED THE SHAVINGS INTOA SACRIFICIAL BLAZE PRESENTLY AFTER MANY HASTY SNATCHES INTO THE FIREAND STILL HASTIER WITHDRAWALS OF HIS FINGERS WHEREBY HE SEEMED TO BESCORCHING THEM BADLY HE AT LAST SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING OUT THE BISCUITTHEN BLOWING OFF THE HEAT AND ASHES A LITTLE HE MADE A POLITE OFFER OFIT TO THE LITTLE NEGRO BUT THE LITTLE DEVIL DID NOT SEEM TO FANCY SUCHDRY SORT OF FARE AT ALL HE NEVER MOVED HIS LIPS ALL THESE STRANGEANTICS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY STILL STRANGER GUTTURAL NOISES FROM THEDEVOTEE WHO SEEMED TO BE PRAYING IN A SINGSONG OR ELSE SINGING SOMEPAGAN PSALMODY OR OTHER DURING WHICH HIS FACE TWITCHED ABOUT IN THEMOST UNNATURAL MANNER AT LAST EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE HE TOOK THE IDOLUP VERY UNCEREMONIOUSLY AND BAGGED IT AGAIN IN HIS GREGO POCKET ASCARELESSLY AS IF HE WERE A SPORTSMAN BAGGING A DEAD WOODCOCKALL THESE QUEER PROCEEDINGS INCREASED MY UNCOMFORTABLENESS ANDSEEING HIM NOW EXHIBITING STRONG SYMPTOMS OF CONCLUDING HIS BUSINESSOPERATIONS AND JUMPING INTO BED WITH ME I THOUGHT IT WAS HIGH TIMENOW OR NEVER BEFORE THE LIGHT WAS PUT OUT TO BREAK THE SPELL IN WHICHI HAD SO LONG BEEN BOUNDBUT THE INTERVAL I SPENT IN DELIBERATING WHAT TO SAY WAS A FATAL ONETAKING UP HIS TOMAHAWK FROM THE TABLE HE EXAMINED THE HEAD OF IT FOR ANINSTANT AND THEN HOLDING IT TO THE LIGHT WITH HIS MOUTH AT THE HANDLEHE PUFFED OUT GREAT CLOUDS OF TOBACCO SMOKE THE NEXT MOMENT THE LIGHTWAS EXTINGUISHED AND THIS WILD CANNIBAL TOMAHAWK BETWEEN HIS TEETHSPRANG INTO BED WITH ME I SANG OUT I COULD NOT HELP IT NOW AND GIVINGA SUDDEN GRUNT

SOUNDS GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND THATIF IT PLEASED ME HE WOULD DRESS FIRST AND THEN LEAVE ME TO DRESSAFTERWARDS LEAVING THE WHOLE APARTMENT TO MYSELF THINKS I QUEEQUEGUNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THIS IS A VERY CIVILIZED OVERTURE BUT THETRUTH IS THESE SAVAGES HAVE AN INNATE SENSE OF DELICACY SAY WHATYOU WILL IT IS MARVELLOUS HOW ESSENTIALLY POLITE THEY ARE I PAY THISPARTICULAR COMPLIMENT TO QUEEQUEG BECAUSE HE TREATED ME WITH SO MUCHCIVILITY AND CONSIDERATION WHILE I WAS GUILTY OF GREAT RUDENESSSTARING AT HIM FROM THE BED AND WATCHING ALL HIS TOILETTE MOTIONS FORTHE TIME MY CURIOSITY GETTING THE

NEVER WOULD HAVE DREAMT OF GETTING UNDER THE BED TO PUT THEM ON ATLAST HE EMERGED WITH HIS HAT VERY MUCH DENTED AND CRUSHED DOWN OVER HISEYES AND BEGAN CREAKING AND LIMPING ABOUT THE ROOM AS IF

HARPOONEER IN A BROAD SHADBELLIED WAISTCOATFROM THAT BECOMING BOATHEADER CHIEFMATE AND CAPTAIN AND FINALLY ASHIP OWNER BILDAD AS I HINTED BEFORE HAD CONCLUDED HIS ADVENTUROUSCAREER BY WHOLLY RETIRING FROM ACTIVE LIFE AT THE GOODLY AGE OFSIXTY AND DEDICATING HIS REMAINING DAYS TO THE QUIET RECEIVING OF HISWELLEARNED INCOMENOW BILDAD I AM SORRY TO SAY HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING ANINCORRIGIBLE OLD HUNKS AND IN HIS SEAGOING DAYS A BITTER HARDTASKMASTER THEY TOLD ME IN NANTUCKET THOUGH IT CERTAINLY SEEMS ACURIOUS STORY THAT WHEN HE SAILED THE OLD CATEGUT WHALEMAN HIS CREWUPON ARRIVING HOME WERE MOSTLY ALL CARRIED ASHORE TO THE HOSPITAL SOREEXHAUSTED AND WORN OUT FOR A PIOUS MAN ESPECIALLY FOR A QUAKER HE WASCERTAINLY RATHER HARDHEARTED TO SAY THE LEAST HE NEVER USED TO SWEARTHOUGH AT HIS MEN THEY SAID BUT SOMEHOW HE GOT AN INORDINATEQUANTITY OF CRUEL UNMITIGATED HARD WORK OUT OF THEM WHEN BILDAD WAS ACHIEFMATE TO HAVE HIS DRABCOLOURED EYE INTENTLY LOOKING AT YOU MADEYOU FEEL COMPLETELY NERVOUS TILL YOU COULD CLUTCH SOMETHINGA HAMMEROR A MARLINGSPIKE AND GO TO WORK LIKE MAD AT SOMETHING OR OTHERNEVER MIND WHAT INDOLENCE AND IDLENESS PERISHED BEFORE HIM HIS OWNPERSON WAS THE EXACT EMBODIMENT OF HIS UTILITARIAN CHARACTER ON HISLONG GAUNT BODY HE CARRIED NO SPARE FLESH NO SUPERFLUOUS BEARDHIS CHIN HAVING A SOFT ECONOMICAL NAP TO IT LIKE THE WORN NAP OF HISBROADBRIMMED HATSUCH THEN WAS THE PERSON THAT I SAW SEATED ON THE TRANSOM WHEN IFOLLOWED CAPTAIN PELEG DOWN INTO THE CABIN THE SPACE BETWEEN THE DECKSWAS SMALL AND THERE BOLTUPRIGHT SAT OLD BILDAD WHO ALWAYS SAT SOAND NEVER LEANED AND THIS TO SAVE HIS COAT TAILS HIS BROADBRIM WASPLACED BESIDE HIM HIS LEGS WERE STIFFLY CROSSED HIS DRAB VESTURE WASBUTTONED UP TO HIS CHIN AND SPECTACLES ON NOSE HE SEEMED ABSORBED INREADING FROM A PONDEROUS VOLUMEBILDAD CRIED CAPTAIN PELEG AT IT AGAIN BILDAD EH YE HAVEBEEN STUDYING THOSE SCRIPTURES NOW FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS TO MYCERTAIN KNOWLEDGE HOW FAR YE GOT BILDADAS IF LONG HABITUATED TO SUCH PROFANE TALK FROM HIS OLD SHIPMATEBILDAD WITHOUT NOTICING HIS PRESENT IRREVERENCE QUIETLY LOOKED UP ANDSEEING ME GLANCED AGAIN INQUIRINGLY TOWARDS PELEGHE SAYS HES OUR MAN BILDAD SAID PELEG HE WANTS TOSHIPDOST THEE SAID BILDAD IN A HOLLOW TONE AND TURNING ROUND TO MEI DOST SAID I UNCONSCIOUSLY HE WAS SO INTENSE A QUAKERWHAT DO YE THINK OF HIM BILDAD SAID PELEGHELL DO SAID BILDAD EYEING ME AND THEN WENT ON SPELLING AWAYAT HIS BOOK IN A MUMBLING TONE QUITE AUDIBLEI THOUGHT HIM THE QUEEREST OLD QUAKER I EVER SAW ESPECIALLY AS PELEGHIS FRIEND AND OLD SHIPMATE SEEMED SUCH A BLUSTERER BUT I SAIDNOTHING ONLY LOOKING ROUND ME SHARPLY PELEG NOW THREW OPEN A CHESTAND DRAWING FORTH THE SHIPS ARTICLES PLACED PEN AND INK BEFORE HIMAND SEATED HIMSELF AT A LITTLE TABLE I BEGAN TO THINK IT WAS HIGH TIMETO SETTLE WITH MYSELF AT WHAT TERMS I WOULD BE WILLING TO ENGAGE FOR THEVOYAGE I WAS ALREADY AWARE THAT IN THE WHALING BUSINESS THEY PAID NOWAGES BUT ALL HANDS INCLUDING THE CAPTAIN RECEIVED CERTAIN SHARES OFTHE PROFITS CALLED LAYS AND THAT THESE LAYS WERE PROPORTIONED TO THEDEGREE OF IMPORTANCE PERTAINING TO THE RESPECTIVE DUTIES OF THE SHIPSCOMPANY I WAS ALSO AWARE THAT BEING A GREEN HAND AT WHALING MY OWNLAY WOULD NOT BE VERY LARGE BUT CONSIDERING THAT I WAS USED TO THE SEACOULD STEER A SHIP SPLICE A ROPE AND ALL THAT I MADE NO DOUBT THATFROM ALL I HAD HEARD I SHOULD BE OFFERED AT LEAST THE TH LAYTHATIS THE TH PART OF THE CLEAR NET PROCEEDS OF THE VOYAGE WHATEVERTHAT MIGHT EVENTUALLY AMOUNT TO AND THOUGH THE TH LAY WAS WHAT THEYCALL A RATHER LONG LAY YET IT WAS BETTER THAN NOTHING AND IF WE HAD ALUCKY VOYAGE MIGHT PRETTY NEARLY PAY FOR THE CLOTHING I WOULD WEAR OUTON IT NOT TO SPEAK OF MY THREE YEARS BEEF AND BOARD FOR WHICH IWOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY ONE STIVERIT MIGHT BE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS A POOR WAY TO ACCUMULATE A PRINCELYFORTUNEAND SO IT WAS A VERY POOR WAY INDEED BUT I AM ONE OF THOSETHAT NEVER TAKE ON ABOUT PRINCELY FORTUNES AND AM QUITE CONTENT IF THEWORLD IS READY TO BOARD AND LODGE ME WHILE I AM PUTTING UP AT THIS GRIMSIGN OF THE THUNDER CLOUD UPON THE WHOLE I THOUGHT THAT THE TH LAYWOULD BE ABOUT THE FAIR THING BUT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED HAD IBEEN OFFERED THE TH CONSIDERING I WAS OF A BROADSHOULDERED MAKEBUT ONE THING NEVERTHELESS THAT MADE ME A LITTLE DISTRUSTFUL ABOUTRECEIVING A GENEROUS SHARE OF THE PROFITS WAS THIS ASHORE I HAD HEARDSOMETHING OF BOTH CAPTAIN PELEG AND HIS UNACCOUNTABLE OLD CRONY BILDADHOW THAT THEY BEING THE PRINCIPAL PROPRIETORS OF THE PEQUOD THEREFORETHE OTHER AND MORE INCONSIDERABLE AND SCATTERED OWNERS LEFT NEARLY THEWHOLE MANAGEMENT OF THE SHIPS AFFAIRS TO THESE TWO AND I DID NOTKNOW BUT WHAT THE STINGY OLD BILDAD MIGHT HAVE A MIGHTY DEAL TO SAYABOUT SHIPPING HANDS ESPECIALLY AS I NOW FOUND HIM ON BOARD THE PEQUODQUITE AT HOME THERE IN THE CABIN AND READING HIS BIBLE AS IF AT HISOWN FIRESIDE NOW WHILE PELEG WAS VAINLY TRYING TO MEND A PEN WITH HISJACKKNIFE OLD BILDAD TO MY NO SMALL SURPRISE CONSIDERING THAT HE WASSUCH AN INTERESTED PARTY IN THESE PROCEEDINGS BILDAD NEVER HEEDEDUS BUT WENT ON MUMBLING TO HIMSELF OUT OF HIS BOOK LAY NOT UP FORYOURSELVES TREASURES UPON EARTH WHERE MOTHWELL CAPTAIN BILDAD INTERRUPTED PELEG WHAT DYE SAY WHATLAY SHALL WE GIVE THIS YOUNG MANTHOU KNOWEST BEST WAS THE SEPULCHRAL REPLY THE SEVEN HUNDREDAND SEVENTYSEVENTH WOULDNT BE TOO MUCH

BELOW WHERE MOTH AND RUST DO CORRUPTIT WAS AN EXCEEDINGLY LONG LAY THAT INDEED AND THOUGH FROM THEMAGNITUDE OF THE FIGURE IT MIGHT AT FIRST DECEIVE A LANDSMAN YETTHE SLIGHTEST CONSIDERATION WILL SHOW THAT THOUGH SEVEN HUNDRED ANDSEVENTYSEVEN IS A PRETTY LARGE NUMBER YET WHEN YOU COME TO MAKEA TEENTH OF IT YOU WILL THEN SEE I SAY THAT THE SEVEN HUNDRED ANDSEVENTYSEVENTH PART OF A FARTHING IS A GOOD DEAL LESS THAN SEVENHUNDRED AND SEVENTYSEVEN GOLD DOUBLOONS AND SO I THOUGHT AT THE TIMEWHY BLAST YOUR EYES BILDAD CRIED PELEG THOU DOST NOT WANTTO SWINDLE THIS YOUNG MAN HE MUST HAVE MORE THAN

THREW IT OVER HIM ASIT PROMISED TO BE A VERY COLD NIGHT AND HE HAD NOTHING BUT HIS ORDINARYROUND JACKET ON FOR SOME TIME DO ALL I WOULD I COULD NOT GET INTOTHE FAINTEST DOZE I HAD BLOWN OUT THE CANDLE AND THE MERE THOUGHT OFQUEEQUEGNOT FOUR FEET OFFSITTING THERE IN THAT UNEASY POSITIONSTARK ALONE IN THE COLD AND DARK THIS MADE ME REALLY WRETCHED THINK OFIT SLEEPING ALL NIGHT IN THE SAME ROOM WITH A WIDE AWAKE PAGAN ON HISHAMS IN THIS DREARY UNACCOUNTABLE RAMADANBUT SOMEHOW I DROPPED OFF AT LAST AND KNEW NOTHING MORE TILL BREAK OFDAY WHEN LOOKING OVER THE BEDSIDE THERE SQUATTED QUEEQUEG AS IF HEHAD BEEN SCREWED DOWN TO THE FLOOR BUT AS SOON AS THE FIRST GLIMPSE OFSUN ENTERED THE WINDOW UP HE GOT WITH STIFF AND GRATING JOINTSBUT WITH A CHEERFUL LOOK LIMPED TOWARDS ME WHERE I LAY PRESSED HISFOREHEAD AGAIN AGAINST MINE AND SAID HIS RAMADAN WAS OVERNOW AS I BEFORE HINTED I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO ANY PERSONS RELIGIONBE IT WHAT IT MAY SO LONG AS THAT PERSON DOES NOT KILL OR INSULT ANYOTHER PERSON BECAUSE THAT OTHER PERSON DONT BELIEVE IT ALSO BUTWHEN A MANS RELIGION BECOMES REALLY FRANTIC WHEN IT IS A POSITIVETORMENT TO HIM AND IN FINE MAKES THIS EARTH OF OURS AN UNCOMFORTABLEINN TO LODGE IN THEN I THINK IT HIGH TIME TO TAKE THAT INDIVIDUAL ASIDEAND ARGUE THE POINT WITH HIMAND JUST SO I NOW DID WITH QUEEQUEG QUEEQUEG SAID I GET INTOBED NOW AND LIE AND LISTEN TO ME I THEN WENT ON BEGINNING WITHTHE RISE AND PROGRESS OF THE PRIMITIVE RELIGIONS AND COMING DOWN TO THEVARIOUS RELIGIONS OF THE PRESENT TIME DURING WHICH TIME I LABOREDTO SHOW QUEEQUEG THAT ALL THESE LENTS RAMADANS AND PROLONGEDHAMSQUATTINGS IN COLD CHEERLESS ROOMS WERE STARK NONSENSE BAD FOR THEHEALTH USELESS FOR THE SOUL OPPOSED IN SHORT TO THE OBVIOUS LAWS OFHYGIENE AND COMMON SENSE I TOLD HIM TOO THAT HE BEING IN OTHER THINGSSUCH AN EXTREMELY SENSIBLE AND SAGACIOUS SAVAGE IT PAINED ME VERYBADLY PAINED ME TO SEE HIM NOW SO DEPLORABLY FOOLISH ABOUT THISRIDICULOUS RAMADAN OF HIS BESIDES ARGUED I FASTING MAKES THE BODYCAVE IN HENCE THE SPIRIT CAVES IN AND ALL THOUGHTS BORN OF A FASTMUST NECESSARILY BE HALFSTARVED THIS IS THE REASON WHY MOST DYSPEPTICRELIGIONISTS CHERISH SUCH MELANCHOLY NOTIONS ABOUT THEIR HEREAFTERS INONE WORD QUEEQUEG SAID I RATHER DIGRESSIVELY HELL IS AN IDEA FIRSTBORN ON AN UNDIGESTED APPLEDUMPLING AND SINCE THEN PERPETUATED THROUGHTHE HEREDITARY DYSPEPSIAS NURTURED BY RAMADANSI THEN ASKED QUEEQUEG WHETHER HE HIMSELF WAS EVER TROUBLED WITHDYSPEPSIA EXPRESSING THE IDEA VERY PLAINLY SO THAT HE COULD TAKE ITIN HE SAID NO ONLY UPON ONE MEMORABLE OCCASION IT WAS AFTER A GREATFEAST GIVEN BY HIS FATHER THE KING ON THE GAINING OF A GREAT BATTLEWHEREIN FIFTY OF THE ENEMY HAD BEEN KILLED BY ABOUT TWO OCLOCK IN THEAFTERNOON AND ALL COOKED AND EATEN THAT VERY EVENINGNO MORE QUEEQUEG

HAD BEEN GAINED THERE TO BARBECUE ALL THESLAIN IN THE YARD OR GARDEN OF THE VICTOR AND THEN ONE BY ONE THEYWERE PLACED IN GREAT WOODEN TRENCHERS AND GARNISHED ROUND LIKE A PILAUWITH BREADFRUIT AND COCOANUTS AND WITH SOME PARSLEY IN THEIR MOUTHSWERE SENT ROUND WITH THE VICTORS COMPLIMENTS TO ALL HIS FRIENDS JUSTAS THOUGH THESE PRESENTS WERE SO MANY CHRISTMAS TURKEYSAFTER ALL I DO NOT THINK THAT MY REMARKS ABOUT RELIGION MADE MUCHIMPRESSION UPON QUEEQUEG BECAUSE IN THE FIRST PLACE HE SOMEHOW SEEMEDDULL OF HEARING ON THAT IMPORTANT SUBJECT UNLESS CONSIDERED FROM HISOWN POINT OF VIEW AND IN THE SECOND PLACE HE DID NOT MORE THAN ONETHIRD UNDERSTAND ME COUCH MY IDEAS SIMPLY AS I WOULD AND FINALLY HENO DOUBT THOUGHT HE KNEW A GOOD DEAL MORE ABOUT THE TRUE RELIGION THANI DID HE LOOKED AT ME WITH A SORT OF CONDESCENDING CONCERN ANDCOMPASSION AS THOUGH HE THOUGHT IT A GREAT PITY THAT SUCH A SENSIBLEYOUNG MAN SHOULD BE SO HOPELESSLY LOST TO EVANGELICAL PAGAN PIETYAT LAST WE ROSE AND DRESSED AND QUEEQUEG TAKING A PRODIGIOUSLY HEARTYBREAKFAST OF CHOWDERS OF ALL SORTS SO THAT THE LANDLADY SHOULD NOTMAKE MUCH PROFIT BY REASON OF HIS RAMADAN WE SALLIED OUT TO BOARD THEPEQUOD SAUNTERING ALONG AND

THE INCANTATION OF THIS WHITENESS ANDLEARNED WHY IT APPEALS WITH SUCH POWER TO THE SOUL AND MORE STRANGEAND FAR MORE PORTENTOUSWHY AS WE HAVE SEEN IT IS AT ONCE THEMOST MEANING SYMBOL OF SPIRITUAL THINGS NAY THE VERY VEIL OF THECHRISTIANS DEITY AND YET SHOULD BE AS IT IS THE INTENSIFYING AGENTIN THINGS THE MOST APPALLING TO MANKINDIS IT THAT BY ITS INDEFINITENESS IT SHADOWS FORTH THE HEARTLESS VOIDSAND IMMENSITIES OF THE UNIVERSE AND THUS STABS US FROM BEHIND WITH THETHOUGHT OF ANNIHILATION WHEN BEHOLDING THE WHITE DEPTHS OF THE MILKYWAY OR IS IT THAT AS IN ESSENCE WHITENESS IS NOT SO MUCH A COLOUR ASTHE VISIBLE ABSENCE OF COLOUR AND AT THE SAME TIME THE CONCRETE OF ALLCOLOURS IS IT FOR THESE REASONS THAT THERE IS SUCH A DUMB BLANKNESSFULL OF MEANING IN A WIDE LANDSCAPE OF SNOWSA COLOURLESS ALLCOLOUROF ATHEISM FROM WHICH WE SHRINK AND WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT OTHER THEORYOF THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS THAT ALL OTHER EARTHLY HUESEVERY STATELYOR LOVELY EMBLAZONINGTHE SWEET TINGES OF

AHAB THREW HISBROODING SOUL INTO THIS UNFALTERING HUNT HE WOULD NOT PERMIT HIMSELF TOREST ALL HIS HOPES UPON THE ONE CROWNING FACT ABOVE MENTIONED HOWEVERFLATTERING IT MIGHT BE TO THOSE HOPES NOR IN

THERE THEREFORE HE MUST WAIT FOR THE NEXT ENSUING SEASONYET THE PREMATURE HOUR OF THE PEQUODS SAILING HAD PERHAPS BEENCORRECTLY SELECTED BY AHAB WITH A VIEW TO THIS VERY COMPLEXION OFTHINGS BECAUSE AN

PART OF MY TASK METHODICALLY BUT SHALLBE CONTENT TO PRODUCE THE DESIRED IMPRESSION BY SEPARATE CITATIONS OFITEMS PRACTICALLY OR RELIABLY KNOWN TO ME AS A WHALEMAN AND FROM THESECITATIONS I TAKE ITTHE CONCLUSION AIMED AT WILL NATURALLY FOLLOW OFITSELFFIRST I HAVE PERSONALLY KNOWN THREE INSTANCES WHERE A WHALE AFTERRECEIVING A HARPOON HAS EFFECTED A COMPLETE ESCAPE AND AFTER ANINTERVAL IN ONE INSTANCE OF THREE YEARS HAS BEEN AGAIN STRUCK BYTHE SAME HAND AND SLAIN WHEN THE TWO IRONS BOTH MARKED BY THE SAMEPRIVATE CYPHER HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM THE BODY IN THE INSTANCE WHERETHREE YEARS INTERVENED BETWEEN THE FLINGING OF THE TWO HARPOONS AND ITHINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT THE MAN WHO DARTEDTHEM HAPPENING IN THE INTERVAL TO GO IN A TRADING SHIP ON A VOYAGE TOAFRICA WENT ASHORE THERE JOINED A DISCOVERY PARTY AND PENETRATED FARINTO THE INTERIOR WHERE HE TRAVELLED FOR A PERIOD OF NEARLY TWO YEARSOFTEN ENDANGERED BY SERPENTS SAVAGES TIGERS POISONOUS MIASMASWITH ALL THE OTHER COMMON PERILS INCIDENT TO WANDERING IN THE HEART OFUNKNOWN REGIONS MEANWHILE THE WHALE HE HAD STRUCK MUST ALSO HAVEBEEN ON ITS TRAVELS NO DOUBT IT HAD THRICE CIRCUMNAVIGATED THE GLOBEBRUSHING WITH ITS FLANKS ALL THE COASTS OF AFRICA BUT TO NO PURPOSETHIS MAN AND THIS WHALE AGAIN CAME TOGETHER AND THE ONE VANQUISHED THEOTHER I SAY I MYSELF HAVE KNOWN THREE INSTANCES SIMILAR TO THIS THATIS IN TWO OF THEM I SAW THE WHALES STRUCK AND UPON THE SECOND ATTACKSAW THE TWO IRONS WITH THE RESPECTIVE MARKS CUT IN THEM AFTERWARDSTAKEN FROM THE DEAD FISH IN THE THREEYEAR INSTANCE IT SO FELL OUTTHAT I WAS IN THE BOAT BOTH TIMES FIRST AND LAST AND THE LAST TIMEDISTINCTLY RECOGNISED A PECULIAR SORT OF HUGE MOLE UNDER THE WHALESEYE WHICH I HAD OBSERVED THERE THREE YEARS PREVIOUS I SAY THREE YEARSBUT I AM PRETTY SURE IT WAS MORE THAN THAT HERE ARE THREE INSTANCESTHEN WHICH I PERSONALLY KNOW THE TRUTH OF BUT I HAVE HEARD OF MANYOTHER INSTANCES FROM PERSONS WHOSE VERACITY IN THE MATTER THERE IS NOGOOD GROUND TO IMPEACHSECONDLY IT IS WELL KNOWN IN THE SPERM WHALE FISHERY HOWEVER IGNORANTTHE WORLD ASHORE MAY BE OF IT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL MEMORABLEHISTORICAL INSTANCES WHERE A PARTICULAR WHALE IN THE OCEAN HAS BEEN ATDISTANT TIMES AND PLACES POPULARLY COGNISABLE WHY SUCH A WHALE BECAMETHUS MARKED WAS NOT ALTOGETHER AND ORIGINALLY OWING TO HIS BODILYPECULIARITIES AS DISTINGUISHED FROM OTHER WHALES FOR HOWEVER PECULIARIN THAT RESPECT ANY CHANCE WHALE MAY BE THEY SOON PUT AN END TO HISPECULIARITIES BY KILLING HIM AND BOILING HIM DOWN INTO A PECULIARLYVALUABLE OIL NO THE REASON WAS THIS THAT FROM THE FATAL EXPERIENCESOF THE FISHERY THERE HUNG A TERRIBLE PRESTIGE OF PERILOUSNESS ABOUTSUCH A WHALE AS THERE DID ABOUT RINALDO RINALDINI INSOMUCH THATMOST FISHERMEN WERE CONTENT TO RECOGNISE HIM BY MERELY TOUCHING THEIRTARPAULINS WHEN HE WOULD BE DISCOVERED LOUNGING BY THEM ON THE SEAWITHOUT SEEKING TO CULTIVATE A MORE INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE LIKE SOMEPOOR DEVILS

A LARGEONE A RUSSIAN CRAFT BUILT ON THE SIBERIAN COAST AND PURCHASED BY MYUNCLE AFTER BARTERING AWAY THE VESSEL IN WHICH HE SAILED FROM HOMEIN THAT UP AND DOWN MANLY BOOK OF OLDFASHIONED ADVENTURE SO FULLTOO OF HONEST WONDERSTHE VOYAGE OF LIONEL WAFER ONE OF ANCIENTDAMPIERS OLD CHUMSI FOUND A LITTLE MATTER SET DOWN SO LIKE THATJUST QUOTED FROM LANGSDORFF THAT I CANNOT FORBEAR INSERTING IT HERE FORA CORROBORATIVE EXAMPLE IF SUCH BE NEEDEDLIONEL IT SEEMS WAS ON HIS WAY TO JOHN FERDINANDO AS HE CALLSTHE MODERN JUAN FERNANDES IN OUR WAY THITHER HE SAYS ABOUTFOUR OCLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN WE WERE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTYLEAGUES FROM THE MAIN OF AMERICA OUR SHIP FELT A TERRIBLE SHOCK WHICHPUT OUR MEN IN SUCH CONSTERNATION THAT THEY COULD HARDLY TELL WHERE THEYWERE OR WHAT TO THINK BUT EVERY ONE BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR DEATH ANDINDEED THE SHOCK WAS SO SUDDEN AND VIOLENT THAT WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTEDTHE SHIP HAD STRUCK AGAINST A ROCK BUT WHEN THE AMAZEMENT WAS A LITTLEOVER WE CAST THE LEAD AND SOUNDED BUT FOUND NO GROUND THESUDDENNESS OF THE SHOCK MADE THE GUNS LEAP IN THEIR CARRIAGES ANDSEVERAL OF THE MEN WERE SHAKEN OUT OF THEIR HAMMOCKS CAPTAIN DAVIS WHOLAY WITH HIS HEAD ON A GUN WAS THROWN OUT OF HIS CABIN LIONEL THENGOES ON TO IMPUTE THE SHOCK TO AN EARTHQUAKE AND SEEMS TO SUBSTANTIATETHE IMPUTATION BY STATING THAT A GREAT EARTHQUAKE SOMEWHERE ABOUTTHAT TIME DID ACTUALLY DO GREAT MISCHIEF ALONG THE SPANISH LAND BUTI SHOULD NOT MUCH WONDER IF IN THE DARKNESS OF THAT EARLY HOUR OF THEMORNING THE SHOCK WAS AFTER ALL CAUSED BY AN UNSEEN WHALE VERTICALLYBUMPING THE HULL FROM BENEATHI MIGHT PROCEED WITH SEVERAL MORE EXAMPLES ONE WAY OR ANOTHER KNOWN TOME OF THE GREAT POWER AND MALICE AT TIMES OF THE SPERM WHALE IN MORETHAN ONE INSTANCE HE HAS BEEN KNOWN NOT ONLY TO CHASE THE ASSAILINGBOATS BACK TO THEIR SHIPS BUT TO PURSUE THE SHIP ITSELF AND LONGWITHSTAND ALL THE LANCES HURLED AT HIM FROM ITS DECKS THE ENGLISH SHIPPUSIE HALL CAN TELL A STORY ON THAT HEAD AND AS FOR HIS STRENGTHLET ME SAY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN EXAMPLES WHERE THE LINES ATTACHED TO ARUNNING SPERM WHALE HAVE IN A CALM BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE SHIP ANDSECURED THERE THE WHALE TOWING HER GREAT HULL THROUGH THE WATER AS AHORSE WALKS OFF WITH A CART AGAIN IT IS VERY OFTEN OBSERVED THAT IFTHE SPERM WHALE ONCE STRUCK IS ALLOWED TIME TO RALLY HE THEN ACTSNOT SO OFTEN WITH BLIND RAGE AS WITH WILFUL DELIBERATE DESIGNS OFDESTRUCTION TO HIS PURSUERS NOR IS IT WITHOUT CONVEYING SOME ELOQUENTINDICATION OF HIS CHARACTER THAT UPON BEING ATTACKED HE WILL FREQUENTLYOPEN HIS MOUTH AND RETAIN IT IN THAT DREAD EXPANSION FOR SEVERALCONSECUTIVE MINUTES BUT I MUST BE CONTENT WITH ONLY ONE MORE AND ACONCLUDING ILLUSTRATION A REMARKABLE AND MOST SIGNIFICANT ONE BY WHICHYOU WILL NOT FAIL TO SEE THAT NOT ONLY IS THE MOST MARVELLOUS EVENT INTHIS BOOK CORROBORATED BY PLAIN FACTS OF THE PRESENT DAY BUT THAT THESEMARVELS LIKE ALL MARVELS ARE MERE REPETITIONS OF THE AGES SO THAT FORTHE MILLIONTH TIME WE SAY AMEN WITH SOLOMONVERILY THERE IS NOTHINGNEW UNDER THE SUNIN THE SIXTH CHRISTIAN CENTURY LIVED PROCOPIUS A CHRISTIAN MAGISTRATEOF CONSTANTINOPLE IN THE DAYS WHEN JUSTINIAN WAS EMPEROR AND BELISARIUSGENERAL AS MANY KNOW HE WROTE THE HISTORY OF HIS OWN TIMES A WORKEVERY WAY OF UNCOMMON VALUE BY THE BEST AUTHORITIES HE HAS ALWAYS BEENCONSIDERED A MOST TRUSTWORTHY AND UNEXAGGERATING HISTORIAN EXCEPT INSOME ONE OR TWO PARTICULARS NOT AT ALL AFFECTING THE MATTER PRESENTLYTO BE MENTIONEDNOW IN THIS HISTORY OF HIS PROCOPIUS MENTIONS THAT DURING THE TERMOF HIS PREFECTURE AT CONSTANTINOPLE A GREAT SEAMONSTER WAS CAPTUREDIN THE NEIGHBORING PROPONTIS OR SEA OF MARMORA AFTER HAVING DESTROYEDVESSELS AT INTERVALS IN THOSE WATERS FOR A PERIOD OF MORE THAN FIFTYYEARS A FACT THUS SET DOWN IN SUBSTANTIAL HISTORY CANNOT EASILY BEGAINSAID NOR IS THERE ANY REASON IT SHOULD BE OF WHAT PRECISE SPECIESTHIS SEAMONSTER WAS IS NOT MENTIONED BUT AS HE DESTROYED SHIPS ASWELL AS FOR OTHER REASONS HE MUST HAVE BEEN A WHALE AND I AM STRONGLYINCLINED TO THINK A SPERM WHALE AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY FOR A LONGTIME I FANCIED THAT THE SPERM WHALE HAD BEEN ALWAYS UNKNOWN IN THEMEDITERRANEAN AND THE DEEP WATERS CONNECTING WITH IT EVEN NOW I AMCERTAIN THAT THOSE SEAS ARE NOT AND PERHAPS NEVER CAN BE IN THEPRESENT CONSTITUTION OF THINGS A PLACE FOR HIS HABITUAL GREGARIOUSRESORT BUT FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS HAVE RECENTLY PROVED TO ME THAT INMODERN TIMES THERE HAVE BEEN ISOLATED INSTANCES OF THE PRESENCE OF THESPERM WHALE IN THE MEDITERRANEAN I AM TOLD ON GOOD AUTHORITY THATON THE BARBARY COAST A COMMODORE DAVIS OF THE BRITISH NAVY FOUNDTHE SKELETON OF A SPERM WHALE NOW AS A VESSEL OF WAR READILY PASSESTHROUGH THE DARDANELLES HENCE A SPERM WHALE COULD BY THE SAME ROUTEPASS OUT OF THE MEDITERRANEAN INTO THE PROPONTISIN THE PROPONTIS AS FAR AS I CAN LEARN NONE OF THAT PECULIAR SUBSTANCECALLED BRIT IS TO BE FOUND THE ALIMENT OF THE RIGHT WHALE BUT I HAVEEVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE FOOD OF THE SPERM WHALESQUID ORCUTTLEFISHLURKS AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT SEA BECAUSE LARGE CREATURESBUT BY NO MEANS THE LARGEST OF THAT SORT HAVE BEEN FOUND AT ITSSURFACE IF THEN YOU PROPERLY PUT THESE STATEMENTS TOGETHER ANDREASON UPON THEM A BIT YOU WILL CLEARLY PERCEIVE THAT ACCORDING TOALL HUMAN REASONING PROCOPIUSS SEAMONSTER THAT FOR HALF A CENTURYSTOVE THE SHIPS OF A ROMAN EMPEROR MUST IN ALL PROBABILITY HAVE BEEN ASPERM WHALECHAPTER  SURMISESTHOUGH CONSUMED WITH THE HOT FIRE OF HIS PURPOSE AHAB IN ALL HISTHOUGHTS AND ACTIONS EVER HAD IN VIEW THE ULTIMATE CAPTURE OF MOBY DICKTHOUGH HE SEEMED READY TO SACRIFICE ALL MORTAL INTERESTS TO THAT ONEPASSION NEVERTHELESS IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT HE WAS BY NATURE AND LONGHABITUATION FAR TOO WEDDED TO A FIERY WHALEMANS WAYS ALTOGETHER TOABANDON THE COLLATERAL PROSECUTION OF THE VOYAGE OR AT LEAST IFTHIS WERE OTHERWISE THERE WERE NOT WANTING OTHER MOTIVES MUCH MOREINFLUENTIAL WITH HIM IT WOULD BE REFINING TOO MUCH PERHAPS EVENCONSIDERING HIS MONOMANIA TO HINT THAT HIS VINDICTIVENESS TOWARDS THEWHITE WHALE MIGHT HAVE POSSIBLY EXTENDED ITSELF IN SOME DEGREE TO ALLSPERM WHALES AND THAT THE MORE MONSTERS HE SLEW BY SO MUCH THE MORE HEMULTIPLIED THE CHANCES THAT EACH SUBSEQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED WHALE WOULDPROVE TO BE THE HATED ONE HE HUNTED BUT IF SUCH AN HYPOTHESIS BE INDEEDEXCEPTIONABLE THERE WERE STILL ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS WHICH THOUGHNOT SO STRICTLY ACCORDING WITH THE WILDNESS OF HIS RULING PASSION YETWERE BY NO MEANS INCAPABLE OF SWAYING HIMTO ACCOMPLISH HIS OBJECT AHAB MUST USE TOOLS AND OF ALL TOOLS USED INTHE SHADOW OF THE MOON MEN ARE MOST APT TO GET OUT OF ORDER HE KNEWFOR EXAMPLE THAT HOWEVER MAGNETIC HIS ASCENDENCY IN SOME RESPECTS WASOVER STARBUCK YET THAT ASCENDENCY DID NOT COVER THE COMPLETE SPIRITUALMAN ANY MORE THAN MERE CORPOREAL SUPERIORITY INVOLVES INTELLECTUALMASTERSHIP FOR TO THE PURELY SPIRITUAL THE INTELLECTUAL BUT STAND INA SORT OF CORPOREAL RELATION STARBUCKS BODY AND STARBUCKS COERCEDWILL WERE AHABS SO LONG AS AHAB KEPT HIS MAGNET AT STARBUCKSBRAIN STILL HE KNEW THAT FOR ALL THIS THE CHIEF MATE IN HISSOUL ABHORRED HIS CAPTAINS QUEST AND COULD HE WOULD JOYFULLYDISINTEGRATE HIMSELF FROM IT OR EVEN FRUSTRATE IT IT MIGHT BE THATA LONG INTERVAL WOULD ELAPSE ERE THE WHITE WHALE WAS SEEN DURING THATLONG INTERVAL STARBUCK WOULD EVER BE APT TO FALL INTO OPEN RELAPSESOF REBELLION AGAINST HIS CAPTAINS LEADERSHIP UNLESS SOME ORDINARYPRUDENTIAL CIRCUMSTANTIAL INFLUENCES WERE BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON HIMNOT ONLY THAT BUT THE SUBTLE INSANITY OF AHAB RESPECTING MOBY DICK WASNOWAYS MORE SIGNIFICANTLY MANIFESTED THAN IN HIS SUPERLATIVE SENSE ANDSHREWDNESS IN FORESEEING THAT FOR THE PRESENT THE HUNT SHOULD IN SOMEWAY BE STRIPPED OF THAT STRANGE IMAGINATIVE IMPIOUSNESS WHICH NATURALLYINVESTED IT THAT THE FULL TERROR OF THE VOYAGE MUST BE KEPT WITHDRAWNINTO THE OBSCURE BACKGROUND FOR FEW MENS COURAGE IS PROOF AGAINSTPROTRACTED MEDITATION UNRELIEVED BY ACTION THAT WHEN THEY STOOD THEIRLONG NIGHT WATCHES HIS OFFICERS AND MEN MUST HAVE SOME NEARER THINGS TOTHINK OF THAN MOBY DICK FOR HOWEVER EAGERLY AND IMPETUOUSLY THE SAVAGECREW HAD HAILED THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS QUEST YET ALL SAILORS OF ALLSORTS ARE MORE OR LESS CAPRICIOUS AND UNRELIABLETHEY LIVE IN THEVARYING OUTER WEATHER AND THEY INHALE ITS FICKLENESSAND WHENRETAINED FOR ANY OBJECT REMOTE AND BLANK IN THE PURSUIT HOWEVERPROMISSORY OF LIFE AND PASSION IN THE END IT IS ABOVE ALL THINGSREQUISITE THAT TEMPORARY INTERESTS AND EMPLOYMENTS SHOULD INTERVENE ANDHOLD THEM HEALTHILY SUSPENDED FOR THE FINAL DASHNOR WAS AHAB UNMINDFUL OF ANOTHER THING IN TIMES OF STRONG EMOTIONMANKIND DISDAIN ALL BASE CONSIDERATIONS BUT SUCH TIMES ARE EVANESCENTTHE PERMANENT CONSTITUTIONAL CONDITION OF THE MANUFACTURED MAN THOUGHTAHAB IS SORDIDNESS GRANTING THAT THE WHITE WHALE FULLY INCITES THEHEARTS OF THIS MY SAVAGE CREW AND PLAYING ROUND THEIR SAVAGENESS EVENBREEDS A CERTAIN GENEROUS KNIGHTERRANTISM IN THEM STILL WHILE FOR THELOVE OF IT THEY GIVE CHASE TO MOBY DICK THEY MUST ALSO HAVE FOODFOR THEIR MORE COMMON DAILY APPETITES FOR EVEN THE HIGH LIFTED ANDCHIVALRIC CRUSADERS OF OLD TIMES WERE NOT CONTENT TO TRAVERSE TWOTHOUSAND MILES OF LAND TO FIGHT FOR THEIR HOLY SEPULCHRE WITHOUTCOMMITTING BURGLARIES PICKING POCKETS AND GAINING OTHER PIOUSPERQUISITES BY THE

POSSIBLECONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A SUPPRESSED IMPRESSION GAINING GROUND AHAB MUSTOF COURSE HAVE BEEN MOST ANXIOUS TO PROTECT HIMSELF THAT PROTECTIONCOULD ONLY CONSIST IN HIS OWN PREDOMINATING BRAIN AND

TO THE STEERSMAN WHO THUS FAR HAD BEEN HOLDING THESHIP IN THE WIND TO DIMINISH HER HEADWAY HE CRIED OUT IN HIS OLD LIONVOICEUP HELM KEEP HER OFF ROUND THE WORLDROUND THE WORLD THERE IS MUCH IN THAT SOUND TO INSPIRE PROUD FEELINGSBUT WHERETO DOES ALL THAT CIRCUMNAVIGATION CONDUCT ONLY THROUGHNUMBERLESS PERILS TO THE VERY POINT WHENCE WE STARTED WHERE THOSE THATWE LEFT BEHIND SECURE WERE ALL THE TIME BEFORE USWERE THIS WORLD AN ENDLESS PLAIN AND BY SAILING EASTWARD WE COULD FOREVER REACH NEW DISTANCES AND DISCOVER SIGHTS MORE SWEET AND STRANGETHAN ANY CYCLADES OR ISLANDS OF KING SOLOMON THEN THERE WERE PROMISEIN THE VOYAGE BUT IN PURSUIT OF THOSE FAR MYSTERIES WE DREAM OF OR INTORMENTED CHASE OF THAT DEMON PHANTOM THAT SOME TIME OR OTHER SWIMSBEFORE ALL HUMAN HEARTS WHILE CHASING SUCH OVER THIS ROUND GLOBE THEYEITHER LEAD US ON IN BARREN MAZES OR MIDWAY LEAVE US WHELMEDCHAPTER  THE GAMTHE OSTENSIBLE REASON WHY AHAB DID NOT GO ON BOARD OF THE WHALER WE HADSPOKEN WAS THIS THE WIND AND SEA BETOKENED STORMS BUT EVEN HADTHIS NOT BEEN THE CASE HE WOULD NOT AFTER ALL PERHAPS HAVE BOARDEDHERJUDGING BY HIS SUBSEQUENT CONDUCT ON SIMILAR OCCASIONSIF SOIT HAD BEEN THAT BY THE PROCESS OF HAILING HE HAD OBTAINED A NEGATIVEANSWER TO THE QUESTION HE PUT FOR AS IT EVENTUALLY TURNED OUT HECARED NOT TO CONSORT EVEN FOR FIVE MINUTES WITH ANY STRANGER CAPTAINEXCEPT HE COULD CONTRIBUTE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION HE SO ABSORBINGLYSOUGHT BUT ALL THIS MIGHT REMAIN INADEQUATELY ESTIMATED WERE NOTSOMETHING SAID HERE OF THE PECULIAR USAGES OF WHALINGVESSELS WHENMEETING EACH OTHER IN FOREIGN SEAS AND ESPECIALLY ON A COMMONCRUISINGGROUNDIF TWO STRANGERS CROSSING THE PINE BARRENS IN NEW YORK STATE OR THEEQUALLY DESOLATE SALISBURY PLAIN IN ENGLAND IF CASUALLY ENCOUNTERINGEACH OTHER IN SUCH INHOSPITABLE WILDS THESE TWAIN FOR THE LIFE OFTHEM CANNOT WELL AVOID A MUTUAL SALUTATION AND STOPPING FOR A MOMENTTO INTERCHANGE THE NEWS AND PERHAPS SITTING DOWN FOR A WHILEAND RESTING IN CONCERT THEN HOW MUCH MORE NATURAL THAT UPON THEILLIMITABLE PINE BARRENS AND SALISBURY PLAINS OF THE SEA TWO WHALINGVESSELS DESCRYING EACH OTHER AT THE ENDS OF THE EARTHOFF LONEFANNINGS ISLAND OR THE FAR AWAY KINGS MILLS HOW MUCH MORENATURAL I SAY THAT UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THESE SHIPS SHOULD NOTONLY INTERCHANGE HAILS BUT COME INTO STILL CLOSER MORE FRIENDLY ANDSOCIABLE CONTACT AND ESPECIALLY WOULD THIS SEEM TO BE A MATTER OFCOURSE IN THE CASE OF VESSELS OWNED IN ONE SEAPORT AND WHOSE CAPTAINSOFFICERS AND NOT A FEW OF THE MEN ARE PERSONALLY KNOWN TO EACH OTHERAND CONSEQUENTLY HAVE ALL SORTS OF DEAR DOMESTIC THINGS TO TALK ABOUTFOR THE LONG ABSENT SHIP THE OUTWARDBOUNDER PERHAPS HAS LETTERS ONBOARD AT ANY RATE SHE WILL BE SURE TO LET HER HAVE SOME PAPERS OF ADATE A YEAR OR TWO LATER THAN THE LAST ONE ON HER BLURRED AND THUMBWORNFILES AND IN RETURN FOR THAT COURTESY THE OUTWARDBOUND SHIP WOULDRECEIVE THE LATEST WHALING INTELLIGENCE FROM THE CRUISINGGROUND TOWHICH SHE MAY BE DESTINED A THING OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO HER ANDIN DEGREE ALL THIS WILL HOLD TRUE CONCERNING WHALING VESSELS CROSSINGEACH OTHERS TRACK ON THE CRUISINGGROUND ITSELF EVEN THOUGH THEYARE EQUALLY LONG ABSENT FROM HOME FOR ONE OF THEM MAY HAVE RECEIVED ATRANSFER OF LETTERS FROM SOME THIRD AND NOW FAR REMOTE VESSEL ANDSOME OF THOSE LETTERS MAY BE FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE SHIP SHE NOW MEETSBESIDES THEY WOULD EXCHANGE THE WHALING NEWS AND HAVE AN AGREEABLECHAT FOR NOT ONLY WOULD THEY MEET WITH ALL THE SYMPATHIES OF SAILORSBUT LIKEWISE WITH ALL THE PECULIAR CONGENIALITIES ARISING FROM A COMMONPURSUIT AND MUTUALLY SHARED PRIVATIONS AND PERILSNOR WOULD DIFFERENCE OF COUNTRY MAKE ANY VERY ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCETHAT IS SO LONG AS BOTH PARTIES SPEAK ONE LANGUAGE AS IS THE CASEWITH AMERICANS AND ENGLISH THOUGH TO BE SURE FROM THE SMALL NUMBER OFENGLISH WHALERS SUCH MEETINGS DO NOT VERY OFTEN OCCUR AND WHEN THEYDO OCCUR THERE IS TOO APT TO BE A SORT OF SHYNESS BETWEEN THEM FOR YOURENGLISHMAN IS RATHER RESERVED AND YOUR YANKEE HE DOES NOT FANCY THATSORT OF THING IN ANYBODY BUT HIMSELF BESIDES THE ENGLISH WHALERSSOMETIMES AFFECT A KIND OF METROPOLITAN SUPERIORITY OVER THE AMERICANWHALERS REGARDING THE LONG LEAN NANTUCKETER WITH HIS NONDESCRIPTPROVINCIALISMS AS A SORT OF SEAPEASANT BUT WHERE THIS SUPERIORITYIN THE ENGLISH WHALEMEN DOES REALLY CONSIST IT WOULD BE HARD TO SAYSEEING THAT THE YANKEES IN ONE DAY COLLECTIVELY KILL MORE WHALES THANALL THE ENGLISH COLLECTIVELY IN TEN YEARS BUT THIS IS A HARMLESSLITTLE FOIBLE IN THE ENGLISH WHALEHUNTERS WHICH THE NANTUCKETER DOESNOT TAKE MUCH TO HEART PROBABLY BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT HE HAS A FEWFOIBLES HIMSELFSO THEN WE SEE THAT OF ALL SHIPS SEPARATELY SAILING THE SEA THEWHALERS HAVE MOST REASON TO BE SOCIABLEAND THEY ARE SO WHEREAS SOMEMERCHANT SHIPS CROSSING EACH OTHERS WAKE IN THE MIDATLANTIC WILLOFTENTIMES PASS ON WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A SINGLE WORD OF RECOGNITIONMUTUALLY CUTTING EACH OTHER ON THE HIGH SEAS LIKE A BRACE OF DANDIES INBROADWAY AND ALL THE TIME INDULGING PERHAPS IN FINICAL CRITICISM UPONEACH OTHERS RIG AS FOR MENOFWAR WHEN THEY CHANCE TO MEET AT SEATHEY FIRST GO THROUGH SUCH A STRING OF SILLY BOWINGS AND SCRAPINGS SUCHA DUCKING

HOSPITABLE SOCIABLEFREEANDEASY WHALER WHAT DOES THE WHALER DO WHEN SHE MEETS ANOTHERWHALER IN ANY SORT OF DECENT WEATHER SHE HAS A GAM A THING SOUTTERLY UNKNOWN TO ALL OTHER SHIPS THAT THEY NEVER

MERCHANTSEAMENAND ALSO ALL PIRATES AND MANOFWARS MEN AND SLAVESHIP SAILORSCHERISH SUCH A SCORNFUL FEELING TOWARDS WHALESHIPS THIS IS A QUESTIONIT WOULD BE HARD TO ANSWER BECAUSE IN THE CASE OF PIRATES

BLUE PAINTBUT THESE MANIFOLD MISTAKES IN DEPICTING THE WHALE ARE NOT SO VERYSURPRISING AFTER ALL CONSIDER MOST OF THE SCIENTIFIC DRAWINGS HAVEBEEN TAKEN FROM THE STRANDED FISH AND THESE ARE ABOUT AS CORRECT AS ADRAWING OF A WRECKED SHIP WITH BROKEN BACK WOULD CORRECTLY REPRESENTTHE NOBLE ANIMAL ITSELF IN ALL ITS UNDASHED PRIDE OF HULL AND SPARSTHOUGH ELEPHANTS HAVE STOOD FOR THEIR FULLLENGTHS THE LIVING LEVIATHANHAS NEVER YET FAIRLY FLOATED HIMSELF FOR HIS PORTRAIT THE LIVING WHALEIN HIS FULL MAJESTY AND SIGNIFICANCE IS ONLY TO BE SEEN AT SEA INUNFATHOMABLE WATERS AND AFLOAT THE VAST BULK OF HIM IS OUT OF SIGHTLIKE A LAUNCHED LINEOFBATTLE SHIP AND OUT OF THAT ELEMENT IT IS ATHING ETERNALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR MORTAL MAN TO HOIST HIM BODILY INTO THEAIR SO AS TO PRESERVE ALL HIS MIGHTY SWELLS AND UNDULATIONS AND NOTTO SPEAK OF THE HIGHLY PRESUMABLE DIFFERENCE OF CONTOUR BETWEEN A YOUNGSUCKING WHALE AND A FULLGROWN PLATONIAN LEVIATHAN YET EVEN IN THECASE OF ONE OF THOSE YOUNG SUCKING WHALES HOISTED TO A SHIPS DECKSUCH IS THEN THE OUTLANDISH EELLIKE LIMBERED VARYING SHAPE OF HIMTHAT HIS PRECISE EXPRESSION THE DEVIL HIMSELF COULD NOT CATCHBUT IT MAY BE FANCIED THAT FROM THE NAKED SKELETON OF THE STRANDEDWHALE ACCURATE HINTS MAY BE DERIVED TOUCHING HIS TRUE FORM NOT AT ALLFOR IT IS ONE OF THE MORE CURIOUS THINGS ABOUT THIS LEVIATHAN THATHIS SKELETON GIVES VERY LITTLE IDEA OF HIS GENERAL SHAPE THOUGH JEREMYBENTHAMS SKELETON WHICH HANGS FOR CANDELABRA IN THE LIBRARY OFONE OF HIS EXECUTORS CORRECTLY CONVEYS THE IDEA OF A BURLYBROWEDUTILITARIAN OLD GENTLEMAN WITH ALL JEREMYS OTHER LEADING PERSONALCHARACTERISTICS YET NOTHING OF THIS KIND COULD BE INFERRED FROM ANYLEVIATHANS ARTICULATED BONES IN FACT AS THE GREAT HUNTER SAYS THEMERE SKELETON OF THE WHALE BEARS THE SAME RELATION TO THE FULLY INVESTEDAND PADDED ANIMAL AS THE INSECT DOES TO THE CHRYSALIS THAT SO ROUNDINGLYENVELOPES IT THIS PECULIARITY IS STRIKINGLY EVINCED IN THE HEAD ASIN SOME PART OF THIS BOOK WILL BE INCIDENTALLY SHOWN IT IS ALSO VERYCURIOUSLY DISPLAYED IN THE SIDE FIN THE BONES OF WHICH ALMOST EXACTLYANSWER TO THE BONES OF THE HUMAN HAND MINUS ONLY THE THUMB THIS FINHAS FOUR REGULAR BONEFINGERS THE INDEX MIDDLE RING AND LITTLEFINGER BUT ALL THESE ARE PERMANENTLY LODGED IN THEIR FLESHY COVERINGAS THE HUMAN FINGERS IN AN ARTIFICIAL COVERING HOWEVER RECKLESSLYTHE WHALE MAY SOMETIMES SERVE US SAID HUMOROUS STUBB ONE DAY HECAN NEVER BE TRULY SAID TO HANDLE US WITHOUT MITTENSFOR ALL THESE REASONS THEN ANY WAY YOU MAY LOOK AT IT YOU MUST NEEDSCONCLUDE THAT THE GREAT LEVIATHAN IS THAT ONE CREATURE IN THE WORLDWHICH MUST REMAIN UNPAINTED TO THE LAST TRUE ONE PORTRAIT MAY HITTHE MARK MUCH NEARER THAN ANOTHER BUT NONE CAN HIT IT WITH ANY VERYCONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF EXACTNESS SO THERE IS NO EARTHLY WAY OF FINDINGOUT PRECISELY WHAT THE WHALE REALLY LOOKS LIKE AND THE ONLY MODE INWHICH YOU CAN DERIVE EVEN A TOLERABLE IDEA OF HIS LIVING CONTOUR ISBY GOING A WHALING YOURSELF BUT BY SO DOING YOU RUN NO SMALL RISK OFBEING ETERNALLY STOVE AND SUNK BY HIM WHEREFORE IT SEEMS TO ME YOU HADBEST NOT BE TOO FASTIDIOUS IN YOUR CURIOSITY TOUCHING THIS LEVIATHANCHAPTER  OF THE LESS ERRONEOUS

WONDER THAT SOME SPERM WHALEMEN ARE ABSENT FOUR YEARS WITH FOURBARRELS NO WONDER THAT TO MANY SHIP OWNERS WHALING IS BUT A LOSINGCONCERN FOR IT IS THE HARPOONEER THAT MAKES THE VOYAGE AND IF YOU

DART THE HARPOON AND THE LANCE AND NO ROWINGWHATEVER SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF HIM EXCEPT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OBVIOUSTO ANY FISHERMAN I KNOW THAT THIS WOULD SOMETIMES INVOLVE A SLIGHT LOSSOF SPEED IN THE CHASE BUT LONG EXPERIENCE IN VARIOUS WHALEMEN OF MORETHAN ONE NATION HAS CONVINCED ME THAT IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF FAILURESIN THE FISHERY IT HAS NOT BY ANY MEANS BEEN SO MUCH THE SPEED OF THEWHALE AS

CENTURIES AGO THE TONGUE OF THE RIGHTWHALE WAS ESTEEMED A GREAT DELICACY IN FRANCE AND COMMANDED LARGEPRICES THERE ALSO THAT IN HENRY VIIITHS TIME A CERTAIN COOK OF THECOURT OBTAINED A HANDSOME REWARD FOR INVENTING AN ADMIRABLE SAUCE TO BEEATEN WITH BARBACUED PORPOISES WHICH YOU REMEMBER ARE A SPECIES OFWHALE PORPOISES INDEED ARE TO THIS DAY CONSIDERED FINE EATING THEMEAT IS MADE INTO BALLS ABOUT THE SIZE OF BILLIARD BALLS AND BEING WELLSEASONED AND SPICED MIGHT BE TAKEN FOR TURTLEBALLS OR VEAL BALLSTHE OLD MONKS OF DUNFERMLINE WERE VERY FOND OF THEM THEY HAD A GREATPORPOISE GRANT FROM THE CROWNTHE FACT IS THAT AMONG HIS HUNTERS AT LEAST THE WHALE WOULD BY ALLHANDS BE CONSIDERED A NOBLE DISH WERE THERE NOT SO MUCH OF HIM BUTWHEN YOU COME TO SIT DOWN BEFORE A MEATPIE NEARLY ONE HUNDRED

RAREOLD VINTAGES OF PRIME OLD TRAIN OIL ZOGRANDA ONE OF THEIR MOST FAMOUSDOCTORS RECOMMENDS STRIPS OF BLUBBER FOR INFANTS AS BEING EXCEEDINGLYJUICY AND NOURISHING AND THIS REMINDS ME THAT CERTAIN ENGLISHMEN WHOLONG AGO WERE ACCIDENTALLY LEFT IN GREENLAND BY A WHALING VESSELTHATTHESE MEN ACTUALLY LIVED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS ON THE MOULDY SCRAPS OFWHALES WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT ASHORE AFTER TRYING OUT THE BLUBBER AMONGTHE DUTCH WHALEMEN THESE SCRAPS ARE CALLED FRITTERS WHICHINDEED THEY GREATLY RESEMBLE BEING BROWN AND CRISP AND SMELLINGSOMETHING LIKE OLD AMSTERDAM HOUSEWIVES DOUGHNUTS OR OLYCOOKSWHEN FRESH THEY HAVE SUCH AN EATABLE LOOK THAT THE MOST SELFDENYINGSTRANGER CAN HARDLY KEEP HIS HANDS OFFBUT WHAT FURTHER DEPRECIATES THE WHALE AS A CIVILIZED DISH IS HISEXCEEDING RICHNESS HE IS THE GREAT PRIZE OX OF THE SEA TOO FAT TO BEDELICATELY GOOD LOOK AT HIS HUMP WHICH WOULD BE AS FINE EATING AS THEBUFFALOS WHICH IS ESTEEMED A RARE DISH WERE IT NOT SUCH A SOLIDPYRAMID OF FAT BUT THE SPERMACETI ITSELF HOW BLAND AND CREAMY THATIS LIKE THE TRANSPARENT HALFJELLIED WHITE MEAT OF A COCOANUT IN THETHIRD MONTH OF ITS GROWTH YET FAR TOO RICH TO SUPPLY A SUBSTITUTE FORBUTTER NEVERTHELESS MANY WHALEMEN HAVE A METHOD OF ABSORBING IT INTOSOME OTHER SUBSTANCE AND THEN PARTAKING OF IT IN THE LONG TRYWATCHES OF THE NIGHT IT IS A COMMON THING FOR THE SEAMEN TO DIP THEIRSHIPBISCUIT INTO THE HUGE OILPOTS AND LET THEM FRY THERE AWHILE MANYA GOOD SUPPER HAVE I THUS MADEIN THE CASE OF A SMALL SPERM WHALE THE BRAINS ARE ACCOUNTED A FINE DISHTHE CASKET OF THE SKULL IS BROKEN INTO WITH AN AXE

BE ABLE TO TELL ACALFS HEAD FROM THEIR OWN HEADS WHICH INDEED REQUIRES UNCOMMONDISCRIMINATION AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY A YOUNG BUCK WITH ANINTELLIGENT LOOKING CALFS HEAD BEFORE HIM IS SOMEHOW ONE OF THESADDEST SIGHTS YOU CAN SEE THE HEAD LOOKS A SORT OF REPROACHFULLY ATHIM WITH AN ET TU BRUTE EXPRESSIONIT IS NOT PERHAPS ENTIRELY BECAUSE THE WHALE IS SO EXCESSIVELYUNCTUOUS THAT LANDSMEN SEEM TO REGARD THE EATING OF HIM WITH ABHORRENCETHAT APPEARS TO RESULT IN SOME WAY FROM THE CONSIDERATION BEFOREMENTIONED IE THAT A MAN SHOULD EAT A NEWLY MURDERED THING OF THE SEAAND EAT IT TOO BY ITS OWN LIGHT BUT NO DOUBT THE FIRST MAN THAT EVERMURDERED AN OX WAS REGARDED AS A MURDERER PERHAPS HE WAS HUNG AND IFHE HAD BEEN PUT ON HIS TRIAL BY OXEN HE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN ANDHE CERTAINLY DESERVED

AND WHERE IS THE SKIN OF THE WHALE ALREADY YOUKNOW WHAT HIS BLUBBER IS THAT BLUBBER IS SOMETHING OF THE CONSISTENCEOF FIRM CLOSEGRAINED BEEF BUT TOUGHER MORE ELASTIC AND COMPACT ANDRANGES FROM EIGHT OR TEN TO TWELVE AND FIFTEEN INCHES IN THICKNESSNOW HOWEVER PREPOSTEROUS IT MAY AT FIRST SEEM TO TALK OF ANYCREATURES SKIN AS BEING OF THAT SORT OF CONSISTENCE AND THICKNESSYET IN POINT OF FACT THESE ARE NO ARGUMENTS AGAINST SUCH A PRESUMPTIONBECAUSE YOU CANNOT RAISE ANY OTHER DENSE ENVELOPING LAYER FROM THEWHALES BODY BUT THAT SAME BLUBBER AND THE OUTERMOST ENVELOPING LAYEROF ANY ANIMAL IF REASONABLY DENSE WHAT CAN THAT BE BUT THE SKIN TRUEFROM THE UNMARRED DEAD BODY OF THE WHALE YOU MAY SCRAPE OFF WITH YOURHAND AN INFINITELY THIN TRANSPARENT SUBSTANCE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING THETHINNEST

AT ANYRATE IT IS PLEASANT TO READ ABOUT WHALES THROUGH THEIR OWN SPECTACLESAS YOU MAY SAY BUT WHAT I AM DRIVING AT HERE IS THIS THAT SAMEINFINITELY THIN ISINGLASS SUBSTANCE WHICH I ADMIT INVESTS THE ENTIREBODY OF THE WHALE IS NOT SO MUCH TO BE REGARDED AS THE SKIN OF THECREATURE AS THE SKIN OF THE SKIN SO TO SPEAK FOR IT WERE SIMPLYRIDICULOUS TO SAY THAT THE PROPER SKIN OF THE TREMENDOUS WHALE ISTHINNER AND MORE TENDER THAN THE SKIN OF A NEWBORN CHILD BUT NO MOREOF THISASSUMING THE BLUBBER TO BE THE SKIN OF THE WHALE THEN WHEN THIS SKINAS IN THE CASE OF A VERY LARGE SPERM WHALE WILL YIELD

TO SOME OTHER GROUND THEPEQUOD COULD NOT HOPE TO REACH HER SO THE SIGNAL WAS SET TO SEE WHATRESPONSE WOULD BE MADEHERE BE IT SAID THAT LIKE THE VESSELS OF MILITARY MARINES THE SHIPS OFTHE AMERICAN WHALE FLEET HAVE EACH A PRIVATE SIGNAL ALL WHICH SIGNALSBEING COLLECTED IN A BOOK WITH THE NAMES OF THE RESPECTIVE VESSELSATTACHED EVERY CAPTAIN IS PROVIDED WITH IT THEREBY THE WHALECOMMANDERS ARE

INCORRUPTIBLE SEA AND AIR ROLLING ANDFLOWING BETWEEN YET CONSCIENTIOUSLY ADHERING TO THE TIMID QUARANTINE OFTHE LAND HE PEREMPTORILY REFUSED TO COME INTO DIRECT CONTACT WITH THEPEQUODBUT THIS DID BY NO MEANS PREVENT ALL COMMUNICATIONS PRESERVING ANINTERVAL OF SOME FEW YARDS BETWEEN ITSELF AND THE SHIP THE JEROBOAMSBOAT BY THE OCCASIONAL USE OF ITS OARS CONTRIVED TO KEEP PARALLEL TO THEPEQUOD AS

ACCOUNTAND WHAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY LEARNED IT SEEMED THAT THE SCARAMOUCH INQUESTION HAD GAINED A WONDERFUL ASCENDENCY OVER ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THEJEROBOAM HIS STORY WAS THISHE HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY NURTURED AMONG THE CRAZY SOCIETY OF NESKYEUNASHAKERS WHERE HE HAD BEEN A GREAT PROPHET IN THEIR CRACKED SECRETMEETINGS HAVING SEVERAL TIMES DESCENDED FROM HEAVEN BY THE WAY OF ATRAPDOOR ANNOUNCING THE SPEEDY OPENING OF THE SEVENTH VIAL WHICH HECARRIED IN HIS VESTPOCKET BUT WHICH INSTEAD OF CONTAINING GUNPOWDERWAS SUPPOSED TO BE CHARGED WITH LAUDANUM A STRANGE APOSTOLIC WHIMHAVING SEIZED HIM HE HAD LEFT NESKYEUNA FOR NANTUCKET WHERE WITHTHAT CUNNING PECULIAR TO CRAZINESS HE ASSUMED A STEADY COMMONSENSEEXTERIOR AND OFFERED HIMSELF AS A GREENHAND CANDIDATE FOR THEJEROBOAMS WHALING VOYAGE THEY

THESETHUNDERHEADS OVERBOARD AND THEN YOU WILL FLOAT LIGHT AND RIGHTIN DISPOSING OF THE BODY OF A RIGHT WHALE WHEN BROUGHT ALONGSIDE THESHIP THE SAME PRELIMINARY PROCEEDINGS COMMONLY TAKE PLACE AS IN THECASE OF A SPERM WHALE ONLY IN THE LATTER INSTANCE THE HEAD IS CUT OFFWHOLE BUT IN THE FORMER THE LIPS AND TONGUE ARE SEPARATELY REMOVED ANDHOISTED ON DECK WITH ALL THE WELL KNOWN BLACK BONE ATTACHED TO WHAT ISCALLED THE CROWNPIECE BUT NOTHING LIKE THIS IN THE PRESENT CASEHAD BEEN DONE THE CARCASES OF BOTH WHALES HAD DROPPED ASTERN ANDTHE HEADLADEN SHIP NOT A LITTLE RESEMBLED A MULE CARRYING A PAIR OFOVERBURDENING PANNIERSMEANTIME FEDALLAH WAS CALMLY EYEING THE RIGHT WHALES HEAD AND EVERAND ANON GLANCING FROM THE DEEP WRINKLES THERE TO THE LINES IN HIS OWNHAND AND AHAB CHANCED SO TO STAND THAT THE PARSEE OCCUPIED HIS SHADOWWHILE IF THE PARSEES SHADOW WAS THERE AT ALL IT SEEMED ONLY TOBLEND WITH AND LENGTHEN AHABS AS THE CREW TOILED ON LAPLANDISHSPECULATIONS WERE BANDIED AMONG THEM CONCERNING ALL THESE PASSINGTHINGSCHAPTER  THE SPERM WHALES HEADCONTRASTED VIEWHERE NOW ARE TWO GREAT WHALES LAYING THEIR HEADS TOGETHER LET USJOIN THEM AND LAY TOGETHER OUR OWNOF THE GRAND ORDER OF FOLIO LEVIATHANS THE SPERM WHALE AND THE RIGHTWHALE ARE BY FAR THE MOST NOTEWORTHY THEY ARE THE ONLY WHALES REGULARLYHUNTED BY MAN TO THE NANTUCKETER THEY PRESENT THE TWO EXTREMES OF ALLTHE KNOWN VARIETIES OF THE WHALE AS THE EXTERNAL DIFFERENCE BETWEENTHEM IS MAINLY OBSERVABLE IN THEIR HEADS AND AS A HEAD OF EACH IS THISMOMENT HANGING FROM THE PEQUODS SIDE AND AS WE MAY FREELY GO FROMONE TO THE OTHER BY MERELY STEPPING ACROSS THE DECKWHERE ISHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WILL YOU OBTAIN A BETTER CHANCE TO STUDY PRACTICALCETOLOGY THAN HEREIN THE FIRST PLACE YOU ARE STRUCK BY THE GENERAL CONTRAST BETWEEN THESEHEADS BOTH ARE MASSIVE ENOUGH IN ALL CONSCIENCE BUT THERE IS A CERTAINMATHEMATICAL SYMMETRY IN THE SPERM WHALES WHICH THE RIGHT WHALESSADLY LACKS THERE IS MORE CHARACTER IN THE SPERM WHALES HEAD AS YOUBEHOLD IT YOU INVOLUNTARILY YIELD THE IMMENSE SUPERIORITY TO HIM INPOINT OF PERVADING DIGNITY IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE TOO THIS DIGNITYIS HEIGHTENED BY THE PEPPER AND SALT COLOUR OF HIS HEAD AT THE SUMMITGIVING TOKEN OF ADVANCED AGE AND LARGE EXPERIENCE IN SHORT HE IS WHATTHE FISHERMEN TECHNICALLY CALL A GREYHEADED WHALELET US NOW NOTE WHAT IS LEAST DISSIMILAR IN THESE HEADSNAMELY THETWO MOST IMPORTANT ORGANS THE EYE AND THE EAR FAR BACK ON THE SIDE OFTHE HEAD AND LOW DOWN NEAR THE ANGLE OF EITHER WHALES JAW IF YOUNARROWLY SEARCH YOU WILL AT LAST SEE A LASHLESS EYE WHICH YOU WOULDFANCY TO BE A YOUNG COLTS EYE SO OUT OF ALL PROPORTION IS IT TO THEMAGNITUDE OF THE HEADNOW FROM THIS PECULIAR SIDEWAY POSITION OF THE WHALES EYES IT ISPLAIN THAT HE CAN NEVER SEE AN OBJECT WHICH IS EXACTLY AHEAD NO MORETHAN HE CAN ONE EXACTLY ASTERN IN A WORD THE POSITION OF THE WHALESEYES CORRESPONDS TO THAT OF A MANS EARS AND YOU MAY FANCY FORYOURSELF HOW IT WOULD FARE WITH YOU DID YOU SIDEWAYS SURVEY OBJECTSTHROUGH YOUR EARS YOU WOULD FIND THAT YOU COULD ONLY COMMAND SOMETHIRTY DEGREES OF VISION IN ADVANCE OF THE STRAIGHT SIDELINE OF SIGHTAND ABOUT THIRTY MORE BEHIND IT IF YOUR BITTEREST FOE WERE WALKINGSTRAIGHT TOWARDS YOU WITH DAGGER UPLIFTED IN BROAD DAY YOU WOULD NOTBE ABLE TO SEE HIM ANY MORE THAN IF HE WERE STEALING UPON YOU FROMBEHIND IN A WORD YOU WOULD HAVE TWO BACKS SO TO SPEAK BUT AT THESAME TIME ALSO TWO FRONTS SIDE FRONTS FOR WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES THEFRONT OF A MANWHAT INDEED BUT HIS EYESMOREOVER WHILE IN MOST OTHER ANIMALS THAT I CAN NOW THINK OF THE EYESARE SO PLANTED AS IMPERCEPTIBLY TO BLEND THEIR VISUAL POWER SO AS TOPRODUCE ONE PICTURE AND NOT TWO TO THE BRAIN THE PECULIAR POSITION OFTHE WHALES EYES EFFECTUALLY DIVIDED AS THEY ARE BY MANY CUBICFEET OF SOLID HEAD WHICH TOWERS BETWEEN THEM LIKE A GREAT MOUNTAINSEPARATING TWO LAKES IN VALLEYS THIS OF COURSE MUST WHOLLY SEPARATETHE IMPRESSIONS WHICH EACH INDEPENDENT ORGAN IMPARTS THE WHALETHEREFORE MUST SEE ONE DISTINCT PICTURE ON THIS SIDE AND ANOTHERDISTINCT PICTURE ON THAT SIDE WHILE ALL BETWEEN MUST BE PROFOUNDDARKNESS AND NOTHINGNESS TO HIM MAN MAY IN EFFECT BE SAID TO LOOK OUTON THE WORLD FROM A SENTRYBOX WITH TWO JOINED SASHES FOR HIS WINDOWBUT WITH THE WHALE THESE TWO SASHES ARE SEPARATELY INSERTED MAKING TWODISTINCT WINDOWS BUT SADLY IMPAIRING THE VIEW THIS PECULIARITY OF THEWHALES EYES IS A THING ALWAYS TO BE BORNE IN MIND IN THE FISHERY ANDTO BE REMEMBERED BY THE READER IN SOME SUBSEQUENT SCENESA CURIOUS AND MOST PUZZLING QUESTION MIGHT BE STARTED CONCERNING THISVISUAL MATTER AS TOUCHING THE LEVIATHAN BUT I MUST BE CONTENT WITH AHINT SO LONG AS A MANS EYES ARE OPEN IN THE LIGHT THE ACT OFSEEING IS INVOLUNTARY THAT IS HE CANNOT THEN HELP MECHANICALLY SEEINGWHATEVER OBJECTS ARE BEFORE HIM NEVERTHELESS ANY ONES EXPERIENCEWILL TEACH HIM THAT THOUGH HE CAN TAKE IN AN UNDISCRIMINATING SWEEP OFTHINGS AT ONE GLANCE IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM ATTENTIVELYAND COMPLETELY TO EXAMINE ANY TWO THINGSHOWEVER LARGE OR HOWEVERSMALLAT ONE AND THE SAME INSTANT OF TIME NEVER MIND IF THEY LIE SIDEBY SIDE AND TOUCH EACH OTHER BUT IF YOU NOW COME TO SEPARATE THESE TWOOBJECTS AND SURROUND EACH BY A CIRCLE OF PROFOUND DARKNESS THEN INORDER TO SEE ONE OF THEM IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO BRING YOUR MIND TOBEAR ON IT THE OTHER WILL BE UTTERLY EXCLUDED FROM YOUR CONTEMPORARYCONSCIOUSNESS HOW IS IT THEN WITH THE WHALE TRUE BOTH HIS EYESIN THEMSELVES MUST SIMULTANEOUSLY ACT BUT IS HIS BRAIN SO MUCH MORECOMPREHENSIVE COMBINING AND SUBTLE THAN MANS THAT HE CAN AT THESAME MOMENT OF TIME ATTENTIVELY EXAMINE TWO DISTINCT PROSPECTS ONE ONONE SIDE OF HIM AND THE OTHER IN AN EXACTLY OPPOSITE DIRECTION IFHE CAN THEN IS IT AS MARVELLOUS A THING IN HIM AS IF A MAN WERE ABLESIMULTANEOUSLY TO GO THROUGH THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF TWO DISTINCT PROBLEMSIN EUCLID NOR STRICTLY INVESTIGATED IS THERE ANY INCONGRUITY IN THISCOMPARISONIT MAY BE BUT AN IDLE WHIM BUT IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT THEEXTRAORDINARY VACILLATIONS OF MOVEMENT DISPLAYED BY SOME WHALES WHENBESET BY THREE OR FOUR BOATS THE TIMIDITY AND LIABILITY TO QUEERFRIGHTS SO COMMON TO SUCH WHALES I THINK THAT ALL THIS INDIRECTLYPROCEEDS FROM THE HELPLESS PERPLEXITY OF VOLITION IN WHICH THEIRDIVIDED AND DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE POWERS OF VISION MUST INVOLVE THEMBUT THE EAR OF THE WHALE IS FULL AS CURIOUS AS THE EYE IF YOU ARE ANENTIRE STRANGER TO THEIR RACE YOU MIGHT HUNT OVER THESE TWO HEADSFOR HOURS AND NEVER DISCOVER THAT ORGAN THE EAR HAS NO EXTERNAL LEAFWHATEVER AND INTO THE HOLE ITSELF YOU CAN HARDLY INSERT A QUILL SOWONDROUSLY MINUTE IS IT IT IS LODGED A LITTLE BEHIND THE EYE WITHRESPECT TO THEIR EARS THIS IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IS TO BE OBSERVEDBETWEEN THE SPERM WHALE AND THE RIGHT WHILE THE EAR OF THE FORMER HASAN EXTERNAL OPENING THAT OF THE LATTER IS ENTIRELY AND EVENLY COVEREDOVER WITH A MEMBRANE SO AS TO BE QUITE IMPERCEPTIBLE FROM WITHOUTIS IT NOT CURIOUS THAT SO VAST A BEING AS THE WHALE SHOULD SEE THEWORLD THROUGH SO SMALL AN EYE AND HEAR THE THUNDER THROUGH AN EAR WHICHIS SMALLER THAN A HARES BUT IF HIS EYES WERE BROAD AS THE LENS OFHERSCHELS GREAT TELESCOPE AND HIS EARS CAPACIOUS AS THE PORCHESOF CATHEDRALS WOULD THAT MAKE HIM ANY LONGER OF SIGHT OR SHARPER OFHEARING NOT AT ALLWHY THEN DO YOU TRY TO ENLARGE YOUR MINDSUBTILIZE ITLET US NOW WITH WHATEVER LEVERS AND STEAMENGINES WE HAVE AT HANDCANT OVER THE SPERM WHALES HEAD THAT IT MAY LIE BOTTOM UP THENASCENDING BY A LADDER TO THE SUMMIT HAVE A PEEP DOWN THE MOUTH ANDWERE IT NOT THAT THE BODY IS NOW COMPLETELY SEPARATED FROM IT WITH ALANTERN WE MIGHT DESCEND INTO THE GREAT KENTUCKY MAMMOTH CAVE OF HISSTOMACH BUT LET US HOLD ON HERE BY THIS TOOTH AND LOOK ABOUT US WHEREWE ARE WHAT A REALLY BEAUTIFUL AND CHASTELOOKING MOUTH FROM FLOORTO CEILING LINED OR RATHER PAPERED WITH A GLISTENING WHITE MEMBRANEGLOSSY AS BRIDAL SATINSBUT COME OUT NOW AND LOOK AT THIS PORTENTOUS LOWER JAW WHICH SEEMSLIKE THE LONG

A SIXBARRELER THAT IS IT WILL YIELD YOU ABOUT THATAMOUNT OF OILERE THIS YOU MUST HAVE PLAINLY SEEN THE TRUTH OF WHAT I STARTEDWITHTHAT THE SPERM WHALE AND THE RIGHT WHALE HAVE ALMOST ENTIRELYDIFFERENT

THAT AMAZING LOWER LIP PRESSED BYACCIDENT AGAINST THE VESSELS SIDE SO AS FIRMLY TO EMBRACE THEJAW DOES NOT THIS WHOLE HEAD SEEM TO SPEAK OF AN ENORMOUS PRACTICALRESOLUTION IN FACING DEATH THIS RIGHT WHALE I TAKE TO HAVE BEEN ASTOIC THE SPERM WHALE A PLATONIAN WHO MIGHT HAVE TAKEN UP SPINOZA INHIS LATTER YEARSCHAPTER  THE BATTERINGRAMERE QUITTING FOR THE NONCE THE SPERM WHALES HEAD I WOULD HAVEYOU

UNEXAGGERATEDINTELLIGENT ESTIMATE OF WHATEVER BATTERINGRAM POWER MAY BE LODGEDTHERE HERE IS A VITAL POINT FOR YOU MUST EITHER SATISFACTORILY SETTLETHIS MATTER WITH YOURSELF OR FOR EVER REMAIN AN INFIDEL AS TO ONE OFTHE MOST APPALLING BUT NOT THE LESS TRUE EVENTS PERHAPS ANYWHERE TO BEFOUND IN ALL RECORDED HISTORYYOU OBSERVE THAT IN THE ORDINARY SWIMMING POSITION OF THE SPERM WHALETHE FRONT OF HIS HEAD PRESENTS AN ALMOST WHOLLY VERTICAL PLANE TO THEWATER YOU OBSERVE THAT THE LOWER PART OF THAT FRONT SLOPES CONSIDERABLYBACKWARDS SO AS TO FURNISH MORE OF A RETREAT FOR THE LONG SOCKET WHICHRECEIVES THE BOOMLIKE LOWER JAW YOU OBSERVE THAT THE MOUTH IS ENTIRELYUNDER THE HEAD MUCH IN THE SAME WAY INDEED AS THOUGH YOUR OWN MOUTHWERE ENTIRELY UNDER YOUR CHIN MOREOVER YOU OBSERVE THAT THE WHALE HASNO EXTERNAL NOSE AND THAT WHAT NOSE HE HASHIS SPOUT HOLEIS ON THETOP OF HIS HEAD YOU OBSERVE THAT HIS EYES AND EARS ARE AT THE SIDESOF HIS HEAD NEARLY ONE THIRD OF HIS ENTIRE LENGTH FROM THE FRONTWHEREFORE YOU MUST NOW HAVE PERCEIVED THAT THE FRONT OF THE SPERMWHALES HEAD IS A DEAD BLIND WALL WITHOUT A SINGLE ORGAN OR TENDERPROMINENCE OF ANY SORT WHATSOEVER FURTHERMORE YOU ARE NOW TO CONSIDERTHAT ONLY IN THE EXTREME LOWER BACKWARD SLOPING PART OF THE FRONT OFTHE HEAD IS THERE THE SLIGHTEST VESTIGE OF BONE AND NOT TILL YOUGET NEAR TWENTY FEET FROM THE FOREHEAD DO YOU COME TO THE FULL CRANIALDEVELOPMENT SO THAT THIS WHOLE ENORMOUS BONELESS MASS IS AS ONE WADFINALLY THOUGH AS WILL SOON BE REVEALED ITS CONTENTS PARTLY COMPRISETHE MOST DELICATE OIL YET YOU ARE NOW TO BE APPRISED OF THE NATURE OFTHE SUBSTANCE WHICH SO IMPREGNABLY INVESTS ALL THAT APPARENT EFFEMINACYIN SOME PREVIOUS PLACE I HAVE DESCRIBED TO YOU HOW THE BLUBBER WRAPS THEBODY OF THE WHALE AS THE RIND WRAPS AN ORANGE JUST SO WITH THE HEADBUT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE ABOUT THE HEAD THIS ENVELOPE THOUGH NOT SOTHICK IS OF A BONELESS TOUGHNESS INESTIMABLE BY ANY MAN WHO HAS NOTHANDLED IT THE SEVEREST POINTED HARPOON THE SHARPEST LANCE DARTED BYTHE STRONGEST HUMAN ARM IMPOTENTLY REBOUNDS FROM IT IT IS AS THOUGHTHE FOREHEAD OF THE SPERM WHALE WERE PAVED WITH HORSES HOOFS I DONOT THINK THAT ANY SENSATION LURKS IN ITBETHINK YOURSELF ALSO OF ANOTHER THING WHEN TWO LARGE LOADED INDIAMENCHANCE TO CROWD AND CRUSH TOWARDS EACH OTHER IN THE DOCKS WHAT DO THESAILORS DO THEY DO NOT SUSPEND BETWEEN THEM AT THE POINT OF COMINGCONTACT ANY MERELY HARD SUBSTANCE LIKE IRON OR WOOD NO THEY HOLDTHERE A LARGE ROUND WAD OF TOW AND CORK ENVELOPED IN THE THICKESTAND TOUGHEST OF OXHIDE THAT BRAVELY AND UNINJURED TAKES THE JAM WHICHWOULD HAVE SNAPPED ALL THEIR OAKEN HANDSPIKES AND IRON CROWBARS BYITSELF THIS SUFFICIENTLY ILLUSTRATES THE OBVIOUS FACT I DRIVE AT BUTSUPPLEMENTARY TO THIS IT HAS HYPOTHETICALLY OCCURRED TO ME THATAS ORDINARY FISH POSSESS WHAT IS CALLED A SWIMMING BLADDER IN THEMCAPABLE AT WILL OF DISTENSION OR CONTRACTION AND AS THE SPERM WHALEAS FAR AS I KNOW HAS NO SUCH PROVISION IN HIM CONSIDERING TOOTHE OTHERWISE INEXPLICABLE MANNER IN WHICH HE NOW DEPRESSES HIS HEADALTOGETHER BENEATH THE SURFACE AND ANON SWIMS WITH IT HIGH ELEVATED OUTOF THE WATER CONSIDERING THE UNOBSTRUCTED ELASTICITY OF ITS ENVELOPECONSIDERING THE UNIQUE INTERIOR OF HIS HEAD IT HAS HYPOTHETICALLYOCCURRED TO ME I SAY THAT THOSE MYSTICAL LUNGCELLED HONEYCOMBS THEREMAY POSSIBLY HAVE SOME HITHERTO UNKNOWN AND UNSUSPECTED CONNEXION WITHTHE OUTER AIR SO AS TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ATMOSPHERIC DISTENSION ANDCONTRACTION IF THIS BE SO FANCY THE IRRESISTIBLENESS OF THAT MIGHT TOWHICH THE MOST IMPALPABLE AND DESTRUCTIVE OF ALL ELEMENTS CONTRIBUTESNOW MARK UNERRINGLY IMPELLING THIS DEAD IMPREGNABLE UNINJURABLEWALL AND THIS MOST BUOYANT THING WITHIN THERE SWIMS BEHIND IT ALL AMASS OF TREMENDOUS LIFE ONLY TO BE ADEQUATELY ESTIMATED AS PILED WOODISBY THE CORD AND ALL OBEDIENT TO ONE VOLITION AS THE SMALLESTINSECT SO THAT WHEN I SHALL HEREAFTER DETAIL TO YOU ALL THESPECIALITIES AND CONCENTRATIONS OF POTENCY EVERYWHERE LURKING IN THISEXPANSIVE MONSTER WHEN I SHALL SHOW YOU SOME OF HIS MORE INCONSIDERABLEBRAINING FEATS I TRUST YOU WILL HAVE RENOUNCED ALL IGNORANTINCREDULITY AND BE READY TO ABIDE BY THIS THAT THOUGH THE SPERM WHALESTOVE A PASSAGE THROUGH THE ISTHMUS OF DARIEN AND MIXED THE ATLANTICWITH THE PACIFIC YOU WOULD NOT ELEVATE ONE HAIR OF YOUR EYEBROW FORUNLESS YOU OWN THE WHALE YOU ARE BUT A PROVINCIAL

VEIL AT LAISCHAPTER  THE GREAT HEIDELBURGH TUNNOW COMES THE BALING OF THE CASE BUT TO COMPREHEND IT ARIGHT YOU MUSTKNOW SOMETHING OF THE CURIOUS INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE THING OPERATEDUPONREGARDING THE SPERM WHALES HEAD AS A SOLID OBLONG YOU MAY ON ANINCLINED PLANE SIDEWAYS DIVIDE IT INTO TWO QUOINS WHEREOF THE LOWERIS THE BONY STRUCTURE FORMING THE CRANIUM AND JAWS AND THE UPPER ANUNCTUOUS MASS WHOLLY FREE FROM BONES ITS BROAD FORWARD END FORMING THEEXPANDED VERTICAL APPARENT FOREHEAD OF THE WHALE AT THE MIDDLE OF THEFOREHEAD HORIZONTALLY SUBDIVIDE THIS UPPER QUOIN AND THEN YOU HAVE TWOALMOST EQUAL PARTS WHICH BEFORE WERE NATURALLY DIVIDED BY AN INTERNALWALL OF A THICK TENDINOUS SUBSTANCEQUOIN IS NOT A EUCLIDEAN TERM IT BELONGS TO THE PURE NAUTICALMATHEMATICS I KNOW NOT THAT IT HAS BEEN DEFINED BEFORE A QUOIN IS ASOLID WHICH DIFFERS FROM A WEDGE IN HAVING ITS SHARP END FORMED BY THESTEEP INCLINATION OF ONE SIDE INSTEAD OF THE MUTUAL TAPERING OF BOTHSIDESTHE LOWER SUBDIVIDED PART CALLED THE JUNK IS ONE IMMENSE HONEYCOMBOF OIL FORMED BY THE CROSSING AND RECROSSING INTO TEN THOUSANDINFILTRATED CELLS OF TOUGH ELASTIC WHITE FIBRES THROUGHOUT ITS WHOLEEXTENT THE UPPER PART

STRANGE DEVICES FOR THE EMBLEMATICAL ADORNMENT OF HISWONDROUS TUN MOREOVER AS THAT OF HEIDELBURGH WAS ALWAYS REPLENISHEDWITH THE MOST EXCELLENT OF THE WINES OF THE RHENISH VALLEYS SO THE TUNOF THE

SAINT ON HORSEBACK YET CONSIDERING THE GREAT IGNORANCEOF THOSE TIMES WHEN THE TRUE FORM OF THE WHALE WAS UNKNOWN TO ARTISTSAND CONSIDERING THAT AS IN PERSEUS CASE ST GEORGES WHALE MIGHTHAVE CRAWLED UP OUT OF THE SEA ON THE BEACH AND CONSIDERING THATTHE ANIMAL RIDDEN BY ST GEORGE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONLY A LARGE SEALOR SEAHORSE BEARING ALL THIS IN MIND IT WILL NOT APPEAR ALTOGETHERINCOMPATIBLE WITH THE

RATE THE WHALE CAUGHT HIM IF HE DID NOT THE WHALE ICLAIM HIM FOR ONE OF OUR CLANBUT BY THE BEST CONTRADICTORY AUTHORITIES THIS GRECIAN STORY OFHERCULES AND THE WHALE IS CONSIDERED TO BE DERIVED FROM THE STILL MOREANCIENT HEBREW STORY OF JONAH AND THE WHALE AND VICE VERSA CERTAINLYTHEY ARE VERY SIMILAR IF I CLAIM THE DEMIGOD THEN WHY NOT THE PROPHETNOR DO HEROES SAINTS DEMIGODS AND PROPHETS ALONE COMPRISE THE WHOLEROLL OF OUR ORDER OUR GRAND MASTER IS STILL TO BE NAMED FOR LIKE ROYALKINGS OF OLD TIMES WE FIND THE HEAD WATERS OF OUR FRATERNITY IN NOTHINGSHORT OF THE GREAT GODS THEMSELVES THAT

VISHNOO THERES AMEMBERROLL FOR YOU WHAT CLUB BUT THE WHALEMANS CAN HEAD OFF LIKETHATCHAPTER  JONAH HISTORICALLY REGARDEDREFERENCE WAS MADE TO THE HISTORICAL STORY OF JONAH AND THE WHALE IN THEPRECEDING CHAPTER NOW SOME NANTUCKETERS RATHER DISTRUST THIS HISTORICALSTORY OF JONAH AND THE WHALE BUT THEN THERE WERE SOME SCEPTICAL GREEKSAND ROMANS WHO STANDING OUT FROM THE ORTHODOX PAGANS OF THEIR TIMESEQUALLY DOUBTED THE STORY OF HERCULES AND THE WHALE AND ARION AND THEDOLPHIN AND YET THEIR DOUBTING THOSE TRADITIONS DID NOT MAKE THOSETRADITIONS ONE WHIT THE LESS FACTS FOR ALL THATONE OLD SAGHARBOR WHALEMANS CHIEF REASON FOR QUESTIONING THE HEBREWSTORY WAS THISHE HAD ONE OF THOSE QUAINT OLDFASHIONED BIBLESEMBELLISHED WITH CURIOUS UNSCIENTIFIC PLATES ONE OF WHICH REPRESENTEDJONAHS WHALE WITH TWO SPOUTS IN HIS HEADA PECULIARITY ONLY TRUEWITH RESPECT TO A SPECIES OF THE LEVIATHAN THE RIGHT WHALE AND THEVARIETIES OF THAT ORDER CONCERNING WHICH THE FISHERMEN HAVE THISSAYING A PENNY ROLL WOULD CHOKE HIM HIS SWALLOW IS SO VERYSMALL BUT TO THIS BISHOP JEBBS ANTICIPATIVE ANSWER IS READY IT ISNOT NECESSARY HINTS THE BISHOP THAT WE CONSIDER JONAH AS TOMBED IN THEWHALES BELLY BUT AS TEMPORARILY LODGED IN SOME PART OF HIS MOUTHAND THIS SEEMS REASONABLE ENOUGH IN THE GOOD BISHOP FOR TRULY THERIGHT WHALES MOUTH WOULD ACCOMMODATE A COUPLE OF WHISTTABLESAND COMFORTABLY SEAT ALL THE PLAYERS POSSIBLY TOO JONAH MIGHT HAVEENSCONCED HIMSELF IN A HOLLOW TOOTH BUT ON SECOND THOUGHTS THE RIGHTWHALE IS TOOTHLESSANOTHER REASON WHICH SAGHARBOR HE WENT BY THAT NAME URGED FOR HISWANT OF FAITH IN THIS MATTER OF THE PROPHET WAS SOMETHING OBSCURELY INREFERENCE TO HIS INCARCERATED BODY AND THE WHALES GASTRIC JUICES BUTTHIS OBJECTION LIKEWISE FALLS TO THE GROUND BECAUSE A GERMAN EXEGETISTSUPPOSES THAT JONAH MUST HAVE TAKEN REFUGE IN THE FLOATING BODY OF ADEAD WHALEEVEN AS THE FRENCH SOLDIERS IN THE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN TURNEDTHEIR DEAD HORSES INTO TENTS AND CRAWLED INTO THEM BESIDES IT HASBEEN DIVINED BY OTHER CONTINENTAL COMMENTATORS THAT WHEN JONAH WASTHROWN OVERBOARD FROM THE JOPPA SHIP HE STRAIGHTWAY EFFECTED HIS ESCAPETO ANOTHER VESSEL NEAR BY SOME VESSEL WITH A WHALE FOR A FIGUREHEADAND I WOULD ADD POSSIBLY CALLED THE WHALE AS SOME CRAFT ARENOWADAYS CHRISTENED THE SHARK THE GULL THE EAGLENOR HAVE THERE BEEN WANTING LEARNED EXEGETISTS WHO HAVE OPINED THAT THEWHALE MENTIONED IN THE BOOK OF JONAH MERELY MEANT A LIFEPRESERVERANINFLATED BAG OF WINDWHICH THE ENDANGERED PROPHET SWAM TO AND SO WASSAVED FROM A WATERY DOOM POOR SAGHARBOR THEREFORE SEEMS WORSTED ALLROUND BUT HE HAD STILL ANOTHER REASON FOR HIS WANT OF FAITH IT WASTHIS IF I REMEMBER RIGHT JONAH WAS SWALLOWED BY THE WHALE IN THEMEDITERRANEAN SEA AND AFTER THREE DAYS HE WAS VOMITED UP SOMEWHEREWITHIN THREE DAYS JOURNEY OF NINEVEH A CITY ON THE TIGRIS VERY MUCHMORE THAN THREE DAYS JOURNEY ACROSS FROM THE NEAREST POINT OF THEMEDITERRANEAN COAST HOW IS THATBUT WAS THERE NO OTHER WAY FOR THE WHALE TO LAND THE PROPHET WITHIN THATSHORT DISTANCE OF NINEVEH YES HE MIGHT HAVE CARRIED HIM ROUND BY THEWAY OF THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE BUT NOT TO SPEAK OF THE PASSAGE THROUGHTHE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND ANOTHER PASSAGE UP THEPERSIAN GULF AND RED SEA SUCH A SUPPOSITION WOULD INVOLVE THE COMPLETECIRCUMNAVIGATION OF ALL AFRICA IN THREE DAYS NOT TO SPEAK OF THE TIGRISWATERS NEAR THE SITE OF NINEVEH BEING TOO SHALLOW FOR ANY WHALE TOSWIM IN BESIDES THIS IDEA OF JONAHS WEATHERING THE CAPE OF GOODHOPE AT SO EARLY A DAY WOULD WREST THE HONOUR OF THE DISCOVERY OF THATGREAT HEADLAND FROM BARTHOLOMEW DIAZ ITS REPUTED DISCOVERER AND SOMAKE MODERN HISTORY A LIARBUT ALL THESE FOOLISH ARGUMENTS OF OLD SAGHARBOR ONLY EVINCED HISFOOLISH PRIDE OF REASONA THING STILL MORE REPREHENSIBLE IN HIMSEEING THAT HE HAD BUT LITTLE LEARNING EXCEPT WHAT HE HAD PICKED UP FROMTHE SUN AND THE SEA I SAY IT ONLY SHOWS HIS FOOLISH IMPIOUS PRIDEAND ABOMINABLE DEVILISH REBELLION AGAINST THE REVEREND CLERGY FOR BY APORTUGUESE CATHOLIC PRIEST THIS VERY IDEA OF JONAHS GOING TO NINEVEHVIA THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE WAS ADVANCED AS A SIGNAL MAGNIFICATION OFTHE GENERAL MIRACLE AND SO IT WAS BESIDES TO THIS DAY THE HIGHLYENLIGHTENED TURKS DEVOUTLY BELIEVE IN THE HISTORICAL STORY OF JONAHAND SOME THREE CENTURIES AGO AN ENGLISH TRAVELLER IN OLD HARRISSVOYAGES SPEAKS OF A TURKISH MOSQUE BUILT IN HONOUR OF JONAH IN WHICHMOSQUE WAS A MIRACULOUS LAMP THAT BURNT WITHOUT ANY OILCHAPTER  PITCHPOLINGTO MAKE THEM RUN EASILY AND SWIFTLY THE AXLES OF CARRIAGES AREANOINTED AND FOR MUCH THE SAME PURPOSE SOME WHALERS PERFORM ANANALOGOUS OPERATION UPON THEIR BOAT THEY GREASE THE BOTTOM NOR IS ITTO BE DOUBTED THAT AS SUCH A PROCEDURE CAN DO NO HARM IT MAY POSSIBLYBE OF NO CONTEMPTIBLE ADVANTAGE CONSIDERING

FREQUENTLY SUCCESSFULON ACCOUNT OF THE GREATER WEIGHT AND INFERIOR LENGTH OF THE HARPOON ASCOMPARED WITH THE LANCE WHICH IN EFFECT BECOME SERIOUS DRAWBACKS AS AGENERAL THING THEREFORE YOU MUST FIRST

SHOULDBE AND YET THAT DOWN TO THIS BLESSED MINUTE FIFTEEN AND A QUARTERMINUTES PAST ONE OCLOCK PM OF THIS SIXTEENTH DAY OF DECEMBER AD IT SHOULD STILL REMAIN A PROBLEM WHETHER THESE SPOUTINGS AREAFTER ALL REALLY WATER OR NOTHING BUT VAPOURTHIS IS SURELY ANOTEWORTHY THINGLET US THEN LOOK AT THIS MATTER ALONG WITH SOME INTERESTING ITEMSCONTINGENT EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT BY THE PECULIAR CUNNING OF THEIRGILLS THE FINNY TRIBES IN GENERAL BREATHE THE AIR WHICH AT ALL TIMES ISCOMBINED WITH THE ELEMENT IN WHICH THEY SWIM HENCE A HERRING OR A CODMIGHT LIVE A CENTURY AND NEVER ONCE RAISE ITS HEAD ABOVE THE SURFACEBUT OWING TO HIS MARKED INTERNAL STRUCTURE WHICH GIVES HIM REGULARLUNGS LIKE A HUMAN BEINGS THE WHALE CAN ONLY LIVE BY INHALING THEDISENGAGED AIR IN THE OPEN ATMOSPHERE WHEREFORE THE NECESSITY FORHIS PERIODICAL VISITS TO THE UPPER WORLD BUT HE CANNOT IN ANY DEGREEBREATHE THROUGH HIS MOUTH FOR IN HIS ORDINARY ATTITUDE THE SPERMWHALES MOUTH IS BURIED AT LEAST EIGHT FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE ANDWHAT IS STILL MORE HIS WINDPIPE HAS NO CONNEXION WITH HIS MOUTH NO HEBREATHES THROUGH HIS SPIRACLE ALONE AND THIS IS ON THE TOP OF HIS HEADIF I SAY THAT IN ANY CREATURE BREATHING IS ONLY A FUNCTIONINDISPENSABLE TO VITALITY INASMUCH AS IT WITHDRAWS FROM THE AIR ACERTAIN ELEMENT WHICH BEING SUBSEQUENTLY BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH THEBLOOD IMPARTS TO THE BLOOD ITS VIVIFYING PRINCIPLE I DO NOT THINK ISHALL ERR THOUGH I MAY POSSIBLY USE SOME SUPERFLUOUS SCIENTIFIC WORDSASSUME IT AND IT FOLLOWS THAT IF ALL THE BLOOD IN A MAN COULD BEAERATED WITH ONE BREATH HE MIGHT THEN SEAL UP HIS NOSTRILS AND NOTFETCH ANOTHER FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME THAT IS TO SAY HE WOULD THENLIVE WITHOUT BREATHING ANOMALOUS AS IT MAY SEEM THIS IS PRECISELY THECASE WITH THE WHALE WHO SYSTEMATICALLY LIVES BY INTERVALS HIS FULLHOUR AND MORE WHEN AT THE BOTTOM WITHOUT DRAWING A SINGLE BREATH ORSO MUCH AS IN ANY WAY INHALING A PARTICLE OF AIR FOR REMEMBER HE HASNO GILLS HOW IS THIS BETWEEN HIS RIBS AND ON EACH SIDE OF HIS SPINEHE IS SUPPLIED WITH A REMARKABLE INVOLVED CRETAN LABYRINTH OFVERMICELLILIKE VESSELS WHICH VESSELS WHEN HE QUITS THE SURFACE ARECOMPLETELY DISTENDED WITH OXYGENATED BLOOD SO THAT FOR AN HOUR OR MOREA THOUSAND FATHOMS IN THE SEA HE CARRIES A SURPLUS STOCK OF VITALITY INHIM JUST AS THE CAMEL CROSSING THE WATERLESS DESERT CARRIES A SURPLUSSUPPLY OF DRINK FOR FUTURE USE IN ITS FOUR SUPPLEMENTARY STOMACHSTHE ANATOMICAL FACT OF THIS LABYRINTH IS INDISPUTABLE AND THAT THESUPPOSITION FOUNDED UPON IT IS REASONABLE AND TRUE SEEMS THE MORECOGENT TO ME WHEN I CONSIDER THE OTHERWISE INEXPLICABLE OBSTINACY OFTHAT LEVIATHAN IN HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT AS THE FISHERMEN PHRASEIT THIS IS WHAT I MEAN IF UNMOLESTED UPON RISING TO THE SURFACE THESPERM WHALE WILL CONTINUE THERE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME EXACTLY UNIFORMWITH ALL HIS OTHER UNMOLESTED RISINGS SAY HE STAYS ELEVEN MINUTES ANDJETS SEVENTY TIMES THAT IS RESPIRES SEVENTY BREATHS THEN WHENEVER HERISES AGAIN HE WILL BE SURE TO HAVE HIS SEVENTY BREATHS OVER AGAIN TOA MINUTE NOW IF AFTER HE FETCHES A FEW BREATHS YOU ALARM HIM SO THATHE SOUNDS HE WILL BE ALWAYS DODGING UP AGAIN TO MAKE GOOD HIS REGULARALLOWANCE OF AIR AND NOT TILL THOSE SEVENTY BREATHS ARE TOLD WILL HEFINALLY GO DOWN TO STAY OUT HIS FULL TERM BELOW REMARK HOWEVER THATIN DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS THESE RATES ARE DIFFERENT BUT IN ANY ONETHEY ARE ALIKE NOW WHY SHOULD THE WHALE THUS INSIST UPON HAVING HISSPOUTINGS OUT UNLESS IT BE TO REPLENISH HIS RESERVOIR OF AIR EREDESCENDING FOR GOOD HOW OBVIOUS IS IT TOO THAT THIS NECESSITY FOR THEWHALES RISING EXPOSES HIM TO ALL THE FATAL HAZARDS OF THE CHASE FORNOT BY HOOK OR BY NET COULD THIS VAST LEVIATHAN BE CAUGHT WHEN SAILINGA THOUSAND FATHOMS BENEATH THE SUNLIGHT NOT SO MUCH THY SKILL THEN OHUNTER AS THE GREAT NECESSITIES THAT STRIKE THE VICTORY TO THEEIN MAN BREATHING IS INCESSANTLY GOING ONONE BREATH ONLY SERVINGFOR TWO OR THREE PULSATIONS SO THAT WHATEVER OTHER BUSINESS HE HAS TOATTEND TO WAKING OR SLEEPING BREATHE HE MUST OR DIE HE WILL BUT THESPERM WHALE ONLY BREATHES ABOUT ONE SEVENTH OR SUNDAY OF HIS TIMEIT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE WHALE ONLY BREATHES THROUGH HIS SPOUTHOLE IFIT COULD TRUTHFULLY BE ADDED THAT HIS SPOUTS ARE MIXED WITH WATER THENI OPINE WE SHOULD BE FURNISHED WITH THE REASON WHY HIS SENSE OF SMELLSEEMS OBLITERATED IN HIM FOR THE ONLY THING ABOUT HIM THAT AT ALLANSWERS TO HIS NOSE IS THAT IDENTICAL SPOUTHOLE AND BEING SO CLOGGEDWITH TWO ELEMENTS IT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO HAVE THE POWER OFSMELLING BUT OWING TO THE MYSTERY OF THE SPOUTWHETHER IT BE WATER ORWHETHER IT BE VAPOURNO ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY CAN AS YET BE ARRIVED AT ONTHIS HEAD SURE IT IS NEVERTHELESS THAT THE SPERM WHALE HAS NO PROPEROLFACTORIES BUT WHAT DOES HE WANT OF THEM NO ROSES NO VIOLETS NOCOLOGNEWATER IN THE SEAFURTHERMORE AS HIS WINDPIPE SOLELY OPENS INTO THE TUBE OF HIS SPOUTINGCANAL AND AS THAT LONG CANALLIKE THE GRAND ERIE CANALIS FURNISHEDWITH A SORT OF LOCKS THAT OPEN AND SHUT FOR THE DOWNWARD RETENTION OFAIR OR THE UPWARD EXCLUSION OF WATER THEREFORE THE WHALE HAS NO VOICEUNLESS YOU INSULT HIM BY SAYING THAT WHEN HE SO STRANGELY RUMBLESHE TALKS THROUGH HIS NOSE BUT THEN AGAIN WHAT HAS THE WHALE TO SAYSELDOM HAVE I KNOWN ANY PROFOUND BEING THAT HAD ANYTHING TO SAY TOTHIS WORLD UNLESS FORCED TO STAMMER OUT SOMETHING BY WAY OF GETTING ALIVING OH HAPPY THAT THE WORLD IS SUCH AN EXCELLENT LISTENERNOW THE SPOUTING CANAL OF THE SPERM WHALE CHIEFLY INTENDED AS ITIS FOR THE CONVEYANCE OF AIR AND FOR SEVERAL FEET LAID ALONGHORIZONTALLY JUST BENEATH THE UPPER SURFACE OF HIS HEAD AND A LITTLETO ONE SIDE THIS CURIOUS CANAL IS VERY MUCH LIKE A GASPIPE LAID DOWNIN A CITY ON ONE SIDE OF A STREET BUT THE QUESTION RETURNS WHETHER THISGASPIPE IS ALSO A WATERPIPE IN OTHER WORDS WHETHER THE SPOUT OF THESPERM WHALE IS THE MERE VAPOUR OF THE EXHALED BREATH OR WHETHER THATEXHALED BREATH IS MIXED WITH WATER TAKEN IN AT THE MOUTH ANDDISCHARGED THROUGH THE SPIRACLE IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE MOUTH INDIRECTLYCOMMUNICATES WITH THE SPOUTING CANAL BUT IT CANNOT BE PROVED THAT THISIS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISCHARGING WATER THROUGH THE SPIRACLE BECAUSETHE GREATEST NECESSITY FOR SO DOING WOULD SEEM TO BE WHEN IN FEEDING HEACCIDENTALLY TAKES IN WATER BUT THE SPERM WHALES FOOD IS FAR BENEATHTHE SURFACE AND THERE HE CANNOT SPOUT EVEN IF HE WOULD BESIDES IFYOU REGARD HIM VERY CLOSELY AND TIME HIM WITH YOUR WATCH YOU WILL FINDTHAT WHEN UNMOLESTED THERE IS AN UNDEVIATING RHYME BETWEEN THE PERIODSOF HIS JETS AND THE ORDINARY PERIODS OF RESPIRATIONBUT WHY PESTER ONE WITH ALL THIS REASONING ON THE SUBJECT SPEAK OUTYOU HAVE SEEN HIM SPOUT THEN DECLARE WHAT THE SPOUT IS CAN YOU NOTTELL WATER FROM AIR MY DEAR SIR IN THIS WORLD IT IS NOT SO EASY TOSETTLE THESE PLAIN THINGS I HAVE EVER FOUND YOUR PLAIN THINGS THEKNOTTIEST OF ALL AND AS FOR THIS WHALE SPOUT YOU MIGHT ALMOST STAND INIT AND YET BE UNDECIDED AS TO WHAT IT IS PRECISELYTHE CENTRAL BODY OF IT IS HIDDEN IN THE SNOWY SPARKLING MIST ENVELOPINGIT AND HOW CAN YOU CERTAINLY TELL WHETHER ANY WATER FALLS FROM ITWHEN ALWAYS WHEN YOU ARE CLOSE ENOUGH TO A WHALE TO GET A CLOSE VIEWOF HIS SPOUT HE IS IN A PRODIGIOUS COMMOTION THE WATER CASCADINGALL AROUND HIM AND IF AT SUCH TIMES YOU SHOULD THINK THAT YOU REALLYPERCEIVED DROPS OF MOISTURE IN THE SPOUT HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARENOT MERELY CONDENSED FROM ITS VAPOUR OR HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THEYARE NOT THOSE IDENTICAL DROPS SUPERFICIALLY LODGED IN THE SPOUTHOLEFISSURE WHICH IS COUNTERSUNK INTO THE SUMMIT OF THE WHALES HEAD FOREVEN WHEN TRANQUILLY SWIMMING THROUGH THE MIDDAY SEA IN A CALM WITHHIS ELEVATED HUMP SUNDRIED AS A DROMEDARYS IN THE DESERT EVEN THENTHE WHALE ALWAYS CARRIES A SMALL BASIN OF WATER ON HIS HEAD AS UNDERA BLAZING SUN YOU WILL SOMETIMES SEE A CAVITY IN A ROCK FILLED UP WITHRAINNOR IS IT AT ALL PRUDENT FOR THE HUNTER TO BE OVER CURIOUS TOUCHING THEPRECISE NATURE OF THE WHALE SPOUT IT WILL NOT DO FOR HIM TO BE PEERINGINTO IT AND PUTTING HIS FACE IN IT YOU CANNOT GO WITH YOUR PITCHER TOTHIS FOUNTAIN AND FILL IT AND BRING IT AWAY FOR EVEN WHEN COMING INTOSLIGHT CONTACT WITH THE OUTER VAPOURY SHREDS OF THE JET WHICH WILLOFTEN HAPPEN YOUR SKIN WILL FEVERISHLY SMART FROM THE ACRIDNESS OFTHE THING SO TOUCHING IT AND I KNOW ONE WHO COMING INTO STILL CLOSERCONTACT WITH THE SPOUT WHETHER WITH SOME SCIENTIFIC OBJECT IN VIEWOR OTHERWISE I CANNOT SAY THE SKIN PEELED OFF FROM HIS CHEEK AND ARMWHEREFORE AMONG WHALEMEN THE SPOUT IS DEEMED POISONOUS THEY TRY TOEVADE IT ANOTHER THING I HAVE HEARD IT SAID AND I DO NOT MUCH DOUBTIT THAT IF THE JET IS FAIRLY SPOUTED INTO YOUR EYES IT WILL BLIND YOUTHE WISEST THING THE INVESTIGATOR CAN DO THEN IT SEEMS TO ME IS TO LETTHIS DEADLY SPOUT ALONESTILL WE CAN HYPOTHESIZE EVEN IF WE CANNOT PROVE AND ESTABLISH MYHYPOTHESIS IS THIS THAT THE SPOUT IS NOTHING BUT MIST AND BESIDESOTHER REASONS TO THIS CONCLUSION I AM IMPELLED BY CONSIDERATIONSTOUCHING THE GREAT INHERENT DIGNITY AND SUBLIMITY OF THE SPERM WHALEI ACCOUNT HIM NO COMMON SHALLOW BEING INASMUCH AS IT IS AN UNDISPUTEDFACT THAT HE IS NEVER FOUND ON SOUNDINGS OR NEAR SHORES ALL OTHERWHALES SOMETIMES ARE HE IS BOTH PONDEROUS AND PROFOUND AND I AMCONVINCED THAT FROM THE HEADS OF ALL PONDEROUS PROFOUND BEINGS SUCH ASPLATO PYRRHO THE DEVIL JUPITER DANTE AND SO ON THERE ALWAYS GOESUP A CERTAIN SEMIVISIBLE STEAM

OF COMMERCE THAT IN  A CERTAIN NANTUCKETBORN CAPTAINCOFFIN WAS EXAMINED AT THE BAR OF THE ENGLISH HOUSE OF COMMONS ON THATSUBJECT FOR AT THAT TIME AND INDEED UNTIL A COMPARATIVELY LATE DAYTHE PRECISE ORIGIN OF AMBERGRIS REMAINED LIKE AMBER ITSELF A PROBLEMTO THE LEARNED THOUGH THE WORD AMBERGRIS IS BUT THE FRENCH COMPOUND FORGREY AMBER YET THE TWO SUBSTANCES ARE QUITE DISTINCT FOR AMBER THOUGHAT TIMES FOUND ON THE SEACOAST IS ALSO DUG UP IN SOME FAR INLANDSOILS WHEREAS AMBERGRIS IS NEVER FOUND EXCEPT UPON THE SEA BESIDESAMBER IS A HARD TRANSPARENT BRITTLE ODORLESS SUBSTANCE USED FORMOUTHPIECES TO PIPES FOR BEADS AND ORNAMENTS BUT AMBERGRIS IS SOFTWAXY AND SO HIGHLY FRAGRANT AND SPICY THAT IT IS LARGELY USED INPERFUMERY IN PASTILES PRECIOUS CANDLES HAIRPOWDERS AND POMATUMTHE TURKS USE IT IN COOKING AND ALSO CARRY IT TO MECCA FOR THE SAMEPURPOSE THAT FRANKINCENSE IS CARRIED TO ST PETERS IN ROME SOME WINEMERCHANTS DROP A FEW GRAINS INTO CLARET TO FLAVOR ITWHO WOULD THINK THEN THAT SUCH FINE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SHOULD REGALETHEMSELVES WITH AN ESSENCE FOUND IN THE INGLORIOUS BOWELS OF A SICKWHALE YET SO IT IS BY SOME AMBERGRIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE CAUSE ANDBY OTHERS THE EFFECT OF THE DYSPEPSIA IN THE WHALE HOW TO CURE SUCHA DYSPEPSIA IT WERE HARD TO SAY UNLESS BY ADMINISTERING THREE OR FOURBOAT LOADS OF BRANDRETHS PILLS AND THEN RUNNING OUT OF HARMS WAYAS LABORERS DO IN BLASTING ROCKSI HAVE FORGOTTEN TO SAY THAT THERE WERE FOUND IN THIS AMBERGRISCERTAIN HARD ROUND BONY PLATES WHICH AT FIRST STUBB THOUGHT MIGHT BESAILORS TROWSERS BUTTONS BUT IT AFTERWARDS TURNED OUT THAT THEY WERENOTHING MORE THAN PIECES OF SMALL SQUID BONES EMBALMED IN THAT MANNERNOW THAT THE INCORRUPTION OF THIS MOST FRAGRANT AMBERGRIS SHOULD BEFOUND IN THE HEART OF SUCH DECAY IS THIS NOTHING BETHINK THEE OF THATSAYING OF ST PAUL IN CORINTHIANS ABOUT CORRUPTION AND INCORRUPTIONHOW THAT WE ARE SOWN IN DISHONOUR BUT RAISED IN GLORY AND LIKEWISECALL TO MIND THAT SAYING OF PARACELSUS ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT MAKETHTHE BEST MUSK ALSO FORGET NOT THE STRANGE FACT THAT OF ALL THINGS OFILLSAVOR COLOGNEWATER IN ITS RUDIMENTAL MANUFACTURING STAGES IS THEWORSTI SHOULD LIKE TO CONCLUDE THE CHAPTER WITH THE ABOVE APPEAL BUT CANNOTOWING TO MY ANXIETY TO REPEL A CHARGE OFTEN MADE AGAINST WHALEMENAND WHICH IN THE ESTIMATION OF SOME ALREADY BIASED MINDS MIGHT BECONSIDERED AS INDIRECTLY SUBSTANTIATED BY WHAT HAS BEEN SAID OF THEFRENCHMANS TWO WHALES ELSEWHERE IN THIS VOLUME THE SLANDEROUSASPERSION HAS BEEN DISPROVED THAT THE VOCATION OF WHALING IS THROUGHOUTA SLATTERNLY UNTIDY BUSINESS BUT THERE IS ANOTHER THING TO REBUT THEYHINT THAT ALL WHALES ALWAYS SMELL BAD NOW HOW DID THIS ODIOUS STIGMAORIGINATEI OPINE THAT IT IS PLAINLY TRACEABLE TO THE FIRST ARRIVAL OF THEGREENLAND WHALING SHIPS IN LONDON MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES AGO BECAUSETHOSE WHALEMEN DID NOT THEN AND DO NOT NOW TRY OUT THEIR OIL AT SEA ASTHE SOUTHERN SHIPS HAVE ALWAYS DONE BUT CUTTING UP THE FRESH BLUBBER INSMALL BITS THRUST IT THROUGH THE BUNG HOLES OF LARGE CASKS AND CARRYIT HOME IN THAT MANNER THE SHORTNESS OF THE SEASON IN THOSE ICY SEASAND THE SUDDEN AND VIOLENT STORMS TO WHICH THEY ARE EXPOSED FORBIDDINGANY OTHER COURSE THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT UPON BREAKING INTO THE HOLDAND UNLOADING ONE OF THESE WHALE CEMETERIES IN THE GREENLAND DOCK ASAVOR IS GIVEN FORTH SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THAT ARISING FROM EXCAVATING ANOLD CITY GRAVEYARD FOR THE FOUNDATIONS OF A LYINGINHOSPITALI PARTLY SURMISE ALSO THAT THIS WICKED CHARGE AGAINST WHALERS MAY BELIKEWISE IMPUTED TO THE EXISTENCE ON THE COAST OF GREENLAND IN FORMERTIMES OF A DUTCH VILLAGE CALLED SCHMERENBURGH OR SMEERENBERG WHICHLATTER NAME IS THE ONE USED BY THE LEARNED FOGO VON SLACK IN HIS GREATWORK ON SMELLS A TEXTBOOK ON THAT

THAT PURPOSE IT WAS A COLLECTION OFFURNACES FATKETTLES AND OIL SHEDS AND WHEN THE WORKS WERE IN FULLOPERATION CERTAINLY GAVE FORTH NO VERY PLEASANT SAVOR BUT ALL THIS ISQUITE DIFFERENT WITH A SOUTH SEA SPERM WHALER WHICH IN A VOYAGE OF FOURYEARS PERHAPS AFTER COMPLETELY FILLING HER HOLD WITH OIL DOES NOTPERHAPS CONSUME FIFTY DAYS IN THE BUSINESS OF BOILING OUT AND IN THESTATE THAT IT IS CASKED THE OIL IS NEARLY SCENTLESS THE TRUTH IS THATLIVING OR DEAD IF BUT DECENTLY TREATED WHALES AS A SPECIES ARE BYNO MEANS CREATURES OF ILL ODOR NOR CAN WHALEMEN BE RECOGNISED AS THEPEOPLE OF THE MIDDLE

ALWAYS OUT OF DOORS THOUGH IT IS TRUE SELDOM IN THEOPEN AIR I SAY THAT THE MOTION OF A SPERM WHALES FLUKES ABOVE WATERDISPENSES A PERFUME AS WHEN A MUSKSCENTED LADY RUSTLES HER DRESS IN AWARM PARLOR

OFENDERBY  SONS A HOUSE WHICH IN MY POOR WHALEMANS OPINION COMES NOTFAR BEHIND THE UNITED ROYAL HOUSES OF THE TUDORS AND BOURBONS IN POINTOF REAL HISTORICAL INTEREST HOW LONG PRIOR TO THE YEAR OF OURLORD  THIS GREAT WHALING HOUSE WAS IN EXISTENCE MY NUMEROUSFISHDOCUMENTS DO NOT MAKE PLAIN BUT IN THAT YEAR  IT FITTEDOUT THE FIRST ENGLISH SHIPS THAT EVER REGULARLY HUNTED THE SPERM WHALETHOUGH FOR SOME SCORE OF YEARS PREVIOUS EVER SINCE  OUR VALIANTCOFFINS AND MACEYS OF NANTUCKET AND THE VINEYARD HAD IN LARGE FLEETSPURSUED THAT LEVIATHAN BUT ONLY IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH ATLANTIC NOTELSEWHERE BE IT DISTINCTLY RECORDED HERE THAT THE NANTUCKETERS WERETHE FIRST AMONG MANKIND TO HARPOON WITH CIVILIZED STEEL THE GREAT SPERMWHALE AND THAT FOR HALF A CENTURY THEY WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE OF THEWHOLE

THOUGH DOUBTLESS THE ORIGINAL SAMUEL MUST LONG AGO HAVESLIPPED HIS CABLE FOR THE GREAT SOUTH SEA OF THE OTHER WORLDTHE SHIP NAMED AFTER HIM WAS WORTHY OF THE HONOUR BEING A VERY FASTSAILER AND A NOBLE CRAFT EVERY WAY I BOARDED HER ONCE AT MIDNIGHTSOMEWHERE OFF THE PATAGONIAN COAST AND DRANK GOOD FLIP DOWN IN THEFORECASTLE IT WAS A FINE GAM WE HAD AND THEY WERE ALL TRUMPSEVERYSOUL ON BOARD A SHORT

THAT PASSED ROUND THE BEEF AND THE BREAD AND THECAN AND THE JOKE AND WERE NOT SOON WEARY OF EATING AND DRINKING ANDLAUGHING I WILL TELL YOU THE ABOUNDING GOOD CHEER OF THESE ENGLISHWHALERS IS MATTER FOR HISTORICAL RESEARCH NOR HAVE I BEEN AT ALLSPARING OF HISTORICAL WHALE RESEARCH WHEN IT HAS SEEMED NEEDEDTHE ENGLISH WERE PRECEDED IN THE WHALE FISHERY BY THE HOLLANDERSZEALANDERS AND DANES FROM

SEEING THAT IT WAS THE PRODUCTION OF ONEFITZ SWACKHAMMER BUT MY FRIEND DR SNODHEAD A VERY LEARNED MANPROFESSOR OF LOW DUTCH AND HIGH GERMAN IN THE COLLEGE OF SANTA CLAUS ANDST POTTS TO WHOM I HANDED THE WORK FOR TRANSLATION GIVING HIM ABOX OF SPERM CANDLES FOR HIS TROUBLETHIS SAME DR SNODHEAD SO SOONAS HE SPIED THE BOOK ASSURED ME THAT DAN COOPMAN DID NOT MEANTHE COOPER BUT THE MERCHANT IN SHORT THIS ANCIENT ANDLEARNED LOW DUTCH BOOK TREATED OF THE COMMERCE OF HOLLAND AND AMONGOTHER SUBJECTS CONTAINED A VERY INTERESTING ACCOUNT OF ITS WHALEFISHERY AND IN THIS CHAPTER IT WAS HEADED SMEER OR

DEVOTED THREE DAYS TO THE STUDIOUS DIGESTING OF ALLTHIS BEER BEEF AND BREAD DURING WHICH MANY PROFOUND THOUGHTS WEREINCIDENTALLY SUGGESTED TO ME CAPABLE OF A TRANSCENDENTAL AND PLATONICAPPLICATION AND FURTHERMORE I COMPILED SUPPLEMENTARY TABLES OF MYOWN TOUCHING THE PROBABLE QUANTITY OF STOCKFISH ETC CONSUMED BYEVERY LOW DUTCH HARPOONEER IN THAT ANCIENT GREENLAND AND SPITZBERGENWHALE FISHERY IN THE

QUANTITY OF BEER TOO IS VERY LARGE  BARRELS NOW AS THOSEPOLAR FISHERIES COULD ONLY BE PROSECUTED IN THE SHORT SUMMER OF THATCLIMATE SO THAT THE WHOLE CRUISE OF ONE OF THESE DUTCH WHALEMENINCLUDING THE

THEUNSPEAKABLE TERRORS OF THE WHALE WHICH HAVING BEEN BEFORE ALL TIMEMUST NEEDS EXIST AFTER ALL HUMANE AGES ARE OVERBUT NOT ALONE HAS THIS LEVIATHAN LEFT HIS PREADAMITE TRACES IN THESTEREOTYPE PLATES OF NATURE AND IN LIMESTONE AND MARL BEQUEATHED HISANCIENT BUST BUT UPON EGYPTIAN TABLETS WHOSE ANTIQUITY SEEMS TO CLAIMFOR THEM AN ALMOST FOSSILIFEROUS CHARACTER WE FIND THE UNMISTAKABLEPRINT OF HIS

SIMILAR TO THE GROTESQUE FIGURES ON THE CELESTIAL GLOBE OF THEMODERNS GLIDING AMONG THEM OLD LEVIATHAN SWAM AS OF YORE WAS THERESWIMMING IN THAT PLANISPHERE CENTURIES BEFORE SOLOMON WAS CRADLEDNOR MUST THERE BE OMITTED ANOTHER STRANGE ATTESTATION OF THE ANTIQUITYOF THE WHALE IN HIS OWN OSSEOUS POSTDILUVIAN REALITY AS SET DOWN BYTHE VENERABLE JOHN LEO THE OLD BARBARY TRAVELLERNOT FAR FROM THE SEASIDE THEY HAVE A TEMPLE THE RAFTERS AND BEAMSOF WHICH ARE MADE OF WHALEBONES FOR WHALES OF A MONSTROUS SIZE AREOFTENTIMES CAST UP DEAD UPON THAT SHORE THE COMMON PEOPLE IMAGINE THATBY A SECRET POWER BESTOWED BY GOD UPON THE TEMPLE NO WHALE CAN PASS ITWITHOUT IMMEDIATE DEATH BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT ON EITHERSIDE OF THE TEMPLE THERE ARE ROCKS THAT SHOOT TWO MILES INTO THE SEAAND WOUND THE WHALES WHEN THEY LIGHT UPON EM THEY KEEP A WHALESRIB OF AN INCREDIBLE LENGTH FOR A MIRACLE WHICH LYING UPON THE GROUNDWITH ITS CONVEX PART UPPERMOST MAKES AN ARCH THE HEAD OF WHICH CANNOTBE REACHED BY A MAN UPON A CAMELS BACK THIS RIB SAYS JOHN LEOIS SAID TO HAVE LAYN THERE A HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE I SAW IT THEIRHISTORIANS AFFIRM THAT A PROPHET WHO PROPHESYD OF MAHOMET CAME FROMTHIS TEMPLE AND SOME DO NOT STAND TO ASSERT THAT THE PROPHET JONAS WASCAST FORTH BY THE WHALE AT THE BASE OF THE TEMPLEIN THIS AFRIC TEMPLE OF THE WHALE I LEAVE YOU READER AND IF YOU BE ANANTUCKETER AND A WHALEMAN YOU WILL SILENTLY WORSHIP THERECHAPTER  DOES THE WHALES MAGNITUDE DIMINISHWILL HE PERISHINASMUCH THEN AS THIS LEVIATHAN COMES FLOUNDERING DOWN UPON US FROMTHE HEADWATERS OF THE ETERNITIES IT MAY BE FITLY INQUIRED WHETHERIN THE LONG COURSE OF HIS GENERATIONS HE HAS NOT DEGENERATED FROM THEORIGINAL BULK OF HIS SIRESBUT UPON INVESTIGATION WE FIND THAT NOT ONLY ARE THE WHALES OF THEPRESENT DAY SUPERIOR IN MAGNITUDE TO THOSE WHOSE FOSSIL REMAINS AREFOUND IN THE TERTIARY SYSTEM EMBRACING A DISTINCT GEOLOGICAL PERIODPRIOR TO MAN BUT OF THE WHALES FOUND IN THAT TERTIARY SYSTEM THOSEBELONGING TO ITS LATTER FORMATIONS EXCEED IN SIZE THOSE OF ITS EARLIERONESOF ALL THE PREADAMITE WHALES YET EXHUMED BY FAR THE LARGEST IS THEALABAMA ONE MENTIONED IN THE LAST CHAPTER AND THAT WAS

I A WHALEMAN MORE THAN HE WAS WILL MAKE BOLD TO TELL HIM SOBECAUSE I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS THAT WHILE THE EGYPTIAN MUMMIESTHAT WERE BURIED THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEFORE EVEN PLINY WAS BORN DO

THE MASTHEADS OF THE WHALESHIPS NOW PENETRATING EVEN THROUGHBEHRINGS STRAITS AND INTO THE REMOTEST SECRET DRAWERS AND LOCKERSOF THE WORLD AND THE THOUSAND HARPOONS AND LANCES DARTED ALONG ALLCONTINENTAL COASTS THE MOOT POINT IS WHETHER LEVIATHAN CAN LONG ENDURESO WIDE A CHASE AND SO REMORSELESS A HAVOC WHETHER HE MUST NOT AT LASTBE EXTERMINATED FROM THE WATERS AND THE LAST WHALE LIKE THE LAST MANSMOKE HIS LAST PIPE AND THEN HIMSELF EVAPORATE IN THE FINAL PUFFCOMPARING THE HUMPED HERDS OF WHALES WITH THE HUMPED HERDS OF BUFFALOWHICH NOT FORTY YEARS AGO OVERSPREAD BY TENS OF

FAVOUR OF THEGRADUAL EXTINCTION OF THE SPERM WHALE FOR EXAMPLE THAT IN FORMER YEARSTHE LATTER PART OF THE LAST CENTURY SAY THESE LEVIATHANS INSMALL PODS WERE ENCOUNTERED MUCH OFTENER THAN AT PRESENT AND INCONSEQUENCE THE VOYAGES WERE NOT SO PROLONGED AND WERE ALSO MUCH MOREREMUNERATIVE BECAUSE AS HAS BEEN ELSEWHERE NOTICED THOSE WHALESINFLUENCED BY SOME VIEWS TO SAFETY NOW SWIM THE SEAS IN

THISMATTERNATURAL AS IT IS TO BE SOMEWHAT INCREDULOUS CONCERNING THE POPULOUSNESSOF THE MORE ENORMOUS CREATURES OF THE GLOBE YET WHAT SHALL WE SAY TOHARTO THE HISTORIAN OF GOA WHEN HE TELLS US THAT AT ONE HUNTING THEKING OF SIAM TOOK  ELEPHANTS THAT IN THOSE REGIONS ELEPHANTS ARENUMEROUS AS DROVES OF CATTLE IN THE TEMPERATE CLIMES AND THERE SEEMS NOREASON TO DOUBT THAT IF THESE ELEPHANTS WHICH HAVE
